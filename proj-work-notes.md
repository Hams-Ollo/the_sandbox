# Project Work Notes

## 2025-03-07: Initial Folder Architecture Setup

### Overview

Today we established the foundational folder architecture for The Sandbox project, following the Batman & Alfred Multi-Agent Framework design. The structure is modular and scalable, designed to support specialized AI agents, knowledge management, and external tool integration.

### Completed Tasks

1. **Created Main Directory Structure**
   - Established `src/` as the main code directory
   - Created specialized subdirectories for different components:
     - `agents/`: For all agent-related code
     - `knowledge_graph/`: For vector database and Neo4j integration
     - `tools/`: For external API integrations and utilities
     - `ui/`: For Gradio-based user interface
     - `core/`: For orchestration and system components
     - `config/`: For configuration management
     - `workflows/`: For workflow templates and examples
     - `tests/`: For unit and integration tests

2. **Implemented Agent Architecture**
   - Created `alfred_prime/` directory for the coordinator agent
   - Established `specialized/` directory for domain-specific agents
   - Implemented base classes and templates for agent development

3. **Set Up Knowledge Graph Components**
   - Created `neo4j/` directory with graph manager implementation
   - Established `vector_db/` directory with embeddings store
   - Added `rag/` directory for retrieval-augmented generation

4. **Implemented Tool Integration Framework**
   - Created tool registry for managing external API integrations
   - Established category-based organization of tools

5. **Set Up UI Components**
   - Implemented Gradio-based web interface
   - Created templates for conversational and voice interaction

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Actual Agent Logic**
   - Develop the core functionality for Alfred Prime coordinator
   - Implement specialized agents for different domains

2. **Connect Knowledge Graph Components**
   - Integrate Neo4j with vector database for hybrid search
   - Implement RAG patterns for knowledge retrieval

3. **Develop Workflow Engine**
   - Create workflow templates for common use cases
   - Implement state management and error handling

4. **Enhance UI**
   - Add more interactive components
   - Implement visualization for agent activities

5. **Add Tests**
   - Create unit tests for core components
   - Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows

### Notes

- The current structure follows a modular design similar to CrewAI's approach
- Each component is designed to be independently testable and replaceable
- The architecture supports the integration of multiple LLM providers
- The system is designed to be extensible with new agents and tools

### Resources

- Batman & Alfred Multi-Agent Framework documentation
- CrewAI documentation for reference on folder structure
- LangGraph and LangChain documentation for agent implementation
