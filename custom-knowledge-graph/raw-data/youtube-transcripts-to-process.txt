Intro
0:00
hey guys in today's video we're going to focus on the number one problem that's holding back 99% of AI developers and
0:06
creators and the problem is that your skills are not getting the attention that they deserve and the reason that this is a problem is if your skills
0:13
aren't getting noticed by the right people they can't hire you they can't pay you and they can't send
0:19
opportunities your way and I know that this is a real problem cuz I had faced it myself I was putting in the work I
0:24
was becoming a better developer and I was building real world projects but no matter what it felt like I was doing it
0:29
felt like I wasn't getting the attention I deserve and I was just going unnoticed and this was super frustrating cuz I
0:34
couldn't land new jobs or new opportunities to get paid more but then I made one single change that completely
0:40
flipped the script and changed everything for me I started to build an AI personal brand and the rest has just
0:45
been crazy s this single change took me from being unknown to tripling my total
0:50
income through new jobs freelancing opportunities digital products coaching and more opportunities than I can
0:56
honestly keep up with and in today's video I'm going to share my entire play and give it all away completely for free
1:02
so that you can start building your own AI personal brand that attracts clients job opportunities and ultimately unlocks
1:09
new income streams for you and the part you'll love the most is that any AI developer or Creator can follow this
1:14
exact Playbook and go off in Crush in fact I've seen it in my own eyes as I've worked with multiple students for
1:20
example I've worked with Tim who is focused on building a YouTube channel around helping developers Implement AI
1:27
into their workflows before working with me Tim was was able to create three videos get a few hundred views and
1:32
around 9 subscribers after working with me and understanding how to properly position himself and create viral
1:38
YouTube content his next three videos ended up generating over 15,000 views
1:43
and hundreds of subscribers he was able to get months of progress in three videos which is insane and this
1:48
ultimately unlocked the ability for him to Rack in new freelance work and ultimately create his own School
1:54
community and he's just been crushing it ever since additionally I've worked with Alexandra who was already figuring out
1:59
the content game but struggling to figure out how to properly monetize it after working through strategy she's now on her way to get over $10,000 a month
2:07
through different freelance opportunities and business opportunities and she's been crushing it but that's not where the story ends because we've
2:13
also helped her unlock the potential of LinkedIn to where now she's able to go off and generate posts that get over
2:19
100,000 views and are just raking in even more paid opportunities for her so she's just absolutely crushing it as
2:25
well and in the rest of this video we're going to be focusing on exactly what steps you need to take as well so that
2:31
you can copy their success and go off and build your own AI personal brand and absolutely crush it and because you guys
2:37
are awesome and I really want you to go off and crush it I went ahead and put together a 5-day email master class on
2:43
building an AI personal brand that goes in much more detail that I'm able to in today's video and I've already went
2:48
ahead and sent it to a few people and they've absolutely loved it so far so I'm sure you as well I'll have a link to it down the description below if you
2:54
want to check it out and get even more support on creating your own AI personal brand but enough of that let's go ahead and actually quickly cover what we're
3:00
going to be doing in the rest of the video first off we're going to talk about what is an AI personal brand and why you should care about it then what
3:06
we're going to dive into next is the five core pillars of creating your own AI personal brand so you can understand
3:12
how they all work together to ultimately just you know work to make you a lot of money and I think you'll definitely want to stay around to the end because pillar
3:18
four and five are my absolute favorite and I'm sure you guys are going to love them too and by the end of this video you're going to have a clear picture and
3:24
acual steps on what you need to do next to go off and create your own AI personal brand and start raking in the money so I hope you guys are super
3:31
excited like I am and let's go ahead and dive into the first part and cover what the heck is an AI personal brand all
What is an AI Personal Brand?
3:36
right so now it's time to go ahead and dive into the fun stuff so what the heck is an AI personal brand well an AI
3:42
personal brand is just like a regular personal brand but it's on steroids it's
3:47
all about showcasing your skills expertise in your projects online without an AI personal brand no one's
3:53
going to know who you are and how you can help them but with an AI personal brand everyone's going to know exactly
3:59
what you do and how you can help them and instead of just being another developer or Creator you're going to be
4:04
tying your name to AI which is the biggest and most in demand skill in the world right now and we're not just going
4:11
to be talking about AI on your personal brand we're going to be using it because right now inside of an AI personal brand
4:17
we're going to be using AI to streamline your content automate your workflows and maximize your output to help you stand
4:23
out even more and it turns your work into a magnet for New Opportunities and with an AI personal brand it's going to
4:30
bring the right opportunities to you and let me tell you why this matters because
4:35
if you don't build an AI personal brand you're going to be forever stuck going off and chasing opportunities so if
4:41
you're trying to get a new job it's going to be you sending applications if you're trying to get new freelance opportunities it's going to be you
4:46
pitching clients and you're just hoping that someone stumbles upon you and just magically notices who you are and what
4:53
you can do but with an AI personal brand it flips the script and opportunities chase you I've seen this with my own and
5:00
it's the craziest thing you'll ever see because once you have an AI personal brand clients are going to reach out to you cuz they already know what you can
5:06
do and how you can help them employers are going to go off and see your work and invite you to go ahead and get a job
5:12
you'll just wake up with DMS in your LinkedIn inbox of hey please come work from us which is a drastic change
5:18
without having an ad personal brand because you're just hoping to God that someone magically responds to one of the
5:24
hundreds of applications that you send out and instead of proving yourself in an interview you're content that you've
5:30
already generated has proven what you're capable of doing so it eliminates all the friction so all the opportunities just flood to your inbox and this is
5:37
exactly like I've said what's happened to me and other AI developers that I've worked with and I will go ahead and say
5:42
that building an AI personal brand isn't for everyone let me explain here's who an AI personal brand is for if you're an
5:48
AI developer or Creator who's already building real world Solutions this is for you if you're someone who loves experimenting with AI creating projects
5:55
and like pushing the boundaries of what's possible you're in the right place and if you're tired of being overlooked and want to start attracting
6:01
inbound opportunities this is going to change everything for you now I will say if you've never built an AI project or
6:08
anything before this is not for you and the first step for you is to actually go off pause and go ahead and start
6:15
focusing on becoming a builder first and luckily for you I've dedicated my entire channel to helping you do just that
6:20
definitely recommend checking out my cayi videos L chain videos and my AI would make videos to go ahead and get started building real world AI solutions
6:27
that enable you to provide value to the world now now that we've kind of clarified you know what an AI personal
6:33
brand is why it matters and also who it's for let's go ahead and start focusing on the next step was making
6:39
sure that you stand out and the reason this is so important is because if you don't position yourself in the right way
6:45
you'll blend in with everyone else and won't stand out which means it's harder for opportunities to come find you and
6:51
that's where our first pillar comes in which is all about defining your brand positioning so let's go ahead and hop
6:57
into pillar number one so we can start going ahead and setting you up for Success on building your own AI personal
7:02
brand oh and real quick before we dive into covering the five pillars of building your AI personal brand I just

10:19

11:13
it'll automatically put you on the wait list so right when applications open the doors open for people to apply on March 10th you'll be the first to know all
11:19
right enough of that let's go ahead and hop back to the five pillars of building your AI personal brand all right so now it's time for us to start diving into
Pillar 1: Brand Positioning
11:25
pillar number one and talk about your brand positioning with inside of your AI personal brand so what is this well your
11:31
brand position is how people online instantly recognize you it's what you do it's who you help and it's why these
11:38
viewers should follow you and if you get this part right picking your Niche it's going to make everything else 10 times
11:44
easier and if you get it wrong like I did when I first started out you're going to waste months creating content
11:49
that no one cares about and it's ultimately just going to confuse your viewers if you don't pick a proper brand
11:55
position so it's super important to note that if you're clear about about your brand positioning the Right audience
12:01
will eventually find you and once they find you they stick around because they know what you stand for and what value
12:06
you provide so let me quickly cover my mistakes when starting out and how I fixed them so that you don't run into
12:12
the same mistakes that I did so when I first started out I had zero positioning I was everywhere at first I was like I'm
12:18
just going to make content about AI so I was like well I'm going to show people how to make a children's book using Ai
12:23
and then I was like o wait I can now use Twitter and I'm going to make an automation bot bot using AWS and then I
12:28
was like well now back to Ai and going to do a landing page so all around I was all over the place and as a result I
12:35
started to gain some small amount of traction but then it was ultimately just confusing my audience cuz they're like
12:40
wait are you about Twitter are you about the cloud are you about AI what are you here to help me for and ultimately I was
12:46
just confusing my entire audience and I really wasn't even building an audience I was just confusing people cuz I was hopping around left and right so here's
12:53
the fix you have to focus and pick a niche now let me tell you how so when you're creating your channel you need to
12:59
dominate a small slice of YouTube you can't be everywhere and the goal is to position yourself as the goto Authority
13:05
on a very specific topic and not just be another Creator creating content all over the place and the more focused you
13:11
are with your Niche the easier it is for you to attract the audience and also more importantly avoid competition so
13:18
something that's super important to know before you dive in to start building your AI personal brand on all these different social media platforms is that
13:24
YouTube in specific is hyperco competitive you have some of the greatest and smart people out there making content and it's really a winner
13:31
take all platform so think of it whoever is the best in a specific topic they're usually the go-to source and it's really
13:38
hard to compete to get views in that same area which is why we want to focus on standing out and not fight for
13:44
attention and here's how we can start doing it and also I do want to mention we just want to make winning easy as we
13:49
go off and build our AI personal brand so here's how we can do it you're going to follow the AI plus two topic
13:55
Frameworks and let me quickly explain what this is so the AI Plus two topic framework is when you combine AI with
14:02
two other topics what this allows you to do is position yourself as the expert but in a specific Niche rather than
14:09
competing with every creator online who's talking about AI so for example let's just imagine that if you wanted to
14:15
say I'm going to be the AI guy well are you going to create content about the newest models that are coming out are
14:21
you going to create content about how AI can be used inside of sales teams are
14:27
you going to talk about how AI can be used for Developers as you can see it's too big and too broad and as a result no
14:33
one's going to know why they should follow you because you're talking about everything all over the place so with our AI plus two topic Frameworks here's
14:40
exactly what you should be doing instead you should pick Ai and then two other topics so in my case I like to talk
14:47
about AI fullstack development and business ultimately I mix all three of these and that little area in the middle
14:54
is how I come up with my Niche so I get to talk a little bit about AI models but how it relates to full stack devel velopment and real world use cases for
15:01
business so that's how I've gone about picking out my specific Niche and I recommend you doing the same and let me
15:07
show you and tell you why this works it's hard to be a top 1% Creator in a broad Niche just like I talked about AI
15:13
as a whole but when you combine all three of those different topics together that overlap right in the middle helps
15:19
you specialize in a specific Niche and just establish your Authority so that you become the go-to person and one of
15:25
the other reasons why this is so easy and so important for beginners starting out the journey is it makes content creation easier
15:31
because you have a clear focus on what you need to be talking about and it prevents you from you know chasing the
15:37
shiny object of like oh that's cool that's cool it really put some blinders on you and help you focus on what you need to be creating also it's going to
15:43
help you attract the right audience it's the people who really care about what you have expertise on and they will just
15:49
as time goes on be you know attracted magnetically over to you because you have all the right problems you've
15:55
already solved them on your channel and they're just going to keep coming back for more and more which is just going to attract even more more similar people in
16:02
the same audience and the other part that makes this so awesome is your audience instantly knows why they should
16:07
follow you because as your topic is really focused on providing you know as your sorry as your content is focused
16:14
strictly on those three different topics and you're showcasing how you can build things solve problems the audience knows
16:20
oh I need to follow him because he's going to help me solve those same problems so that's why people are going to follow you so let me go ahead and
16:26
actually just get really concrete with this and show you a few other examples of this in action so let's go ahead and look at a few different channels that
16:32
are super you know popular on YouTube so Matthew Burman who is he and what is his Niche well as you can see over here on
16:39
the left his channel is mostly focused on you know the trendy new thing that's happening so what he's focused on is AI
16:46
plus news and then use cases of how these different AI are showing up so if you're in his world every time a new
16:54
something with AI pops up you're going to want to go to his channel to watch to see what's going on so this is exactly
16:59
how he has picked it in this way he doesn't have to go too deep into coding he doesn't have to go too deep into anything else he is strictly AI news and
17:06
sharing use cases to inspire other developers and creators in the space another one Jack Roberts awesome Creator
17:12
his Focus as you can see in his channel is focused on Ai No code and automations
17:18
he has an entire School community and YouTube channel dedicated to doing exactly these three things and he has
17:24
become the go-to guy for these different topics additionally another example mvin phenomenal developer HS focus is on AI
17:31
developers and use cases so if you want quick mini tutorials on how to use a new framework for developers that relates to
17:38
AI he always has a video on it and he's very timely so as soon as it come out boom he has a quick tutorial that you
17:45
can see like 5 minutes or less of showing you how to use this new technology and how it can be used so all
17:50
around as you can see just by mixing up these three different variables you can produce wildly different content and
17:57
completely different channels so I'm hoping you're starting to see the power of this framework so here action steps
18:02
for you when it comes to setting up your brand positioning for your new AI personal brand first we want you to
18:08
ultimately pick your Niche and here's how you're going to do it first I recommend going off and researching other YouTube channels in on YouTube
18:16
that you find interesting to see what's working what's not working then I'd like you to reflect on what do you like to
18:22
make and talk about so for example I read business books I in my free time I
18:27
just watch you know all sorts of business podcast so I love business also if you were just to like give me unlimited free time I would just code
18:34
and build all sorts of cool real world projects and I love AI so that's how I picked mine I just like to focus on what
18:39
do I enjoy doing and now I'm going to go off and create content in the real world about that and ultimately attract an
18:45
audience that likes and has the same interest as me so you have to do some inward reflection to figure out what you like next I'm a huge fan of putting out
18:53
a road map of just guessing like okay if I do pick this Niche and I want to focus on these three topics what kind of cont
18:58
content would I create and do I like it if you do like the type of content you would go off and create success you now
19:04
have a great topic that you can focus on if after doing your road map and trying to figure out like well you know I could only really create one video in this
19:11
area if I pick these three topics we might need to take a step back and do and rearrange the different topics we
19:16
pick so you'll hop back to the the reflect stage so you're going to use these three steps together to go off and
19:22
start creating your own AI Niche that you should focus on now now that we've already talked about you know picking
19:28
your personal brand brand we now need to start focusing on the next step which is creating a Content engine where you're
19:33
actually going to produce videos and valuable content that's going to help grow your audience on autopilot and this
19:39
is actually where most people get stuck they have a great idea they're going to do a specific you know Niche on YouTube
19:44
and Linkedin but then they never get started so they either just never make a post because they're afraid or they're
19:50
not sure if it's actually going to provide value or they do one or two posts and then give up because they instantly don't go viral and they never
19:56
get any interraction and that's what we're going to talk about the next section we're going to specifically dive into actually how you can build your
20:02
content engine properly so that it feels much easier and you don't give up and it the whole point of this content engine
20:08
is to actually attract the ride audience go ahead and grow your Authority so deals start coming in and ultimately
20:14
create new opportunities for you to start making money that's what we're here about so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number two where we're
20:19
going to start diving into creating your own content engine so let's go ahead and hop over so now that we've picked a
Pillar 2: Content Engine
20:24
topic that we want to talk about it's time for us to dive into pillar number two where we're going to start talking about how we're going to create our
20:29
content engine that's going to grow our audience on autopilot so before we dive into talking about what is the content
20:36
engine and how it's going to work let's clearly Define what are the goals that we want our content engine to do for us
20:41
and our AI personal brand so first off we want to make sure that our content engine is just more it's more than
20:46
posting videos it really comes down to a system designed to help us with three core goals first we want to make sure
20:53
that our content engine and every piece of content that we produce attracts leads and new opportunities to us 24/7
21:00
around the clock so that we get new deals while we're sleeping that's our goal we also want to make sure that each
21:05
piece of content we're posting helps build Authority so that people trust us as the experts that we are we're smart
21:11
we're competent we know what we're doing we just want the world to know it as well next we want to make sure that each piece of content we create is highly
21:18
leveraged so that each piece of content works for you long after you post it so we want today's work to pay dividends
21:25
for weeks months and years going forward so if you get your content engine strategy right it's going to work for
21:31
you around the clock and each piece of content you produce is going to help it bring in new job offers new clients
21:36
freelancing work coaching clients and honestly more opportunities than you can even keep up with it's once it works
21:41
it's insane how well it pays off but if you get this wrong you're going to waste so much time creating content that no
21:48
one really cares about and it's not going to lead to real world opportunities in the ultimate outcome that you're shooting for so we need to
21:54
get this right now before we dive into like all the exact strategies I just want you to know I have failed on this
22:00
hard in the past in fact before I launched the YouTube channel that you're watching right now I actually launched a
22:05
previous one and it bombed it tanked my big idea was I was going to create a vlog startup that was focused on my
22:12
journey of building an AI startup and as you can see I posted three videos I maxed out at like 100 views the content
22:19
was completely wrong it was all me focused it wasn't focused on providing value to the viewers and it just it
22:25
absolutely crashed in fact on the last video I got two comments one comment was like Hey Watch no one care about what
22:31
you're building and the other one was I hope you fail and I was like this YouTube thing is awful I hate it and I actually gave up I quit right then and
22:37
there and it took a full year before I thought about doing it again but I did not give up that was the important part a full year later I came back and this
22:44
time I was focused on building a real content engine that was going to work for me and I completely changed
22:49
everything about my strategy and once I made this big change everything changed for me and way worked out way better and
22:56
as you can see on this channel it's exploding ever since so here's exactly what you need to do when it comes to
23:02
building your content engine first every time we're creating a new piece of content we want to make sure that it's
23:08
high value and leverageable content and we'll dive deeper into this in just a second next every time we are you know
23:14
making sure that we're producing content we want to make sure that we're going to put it on platforms that have high
23:19
organic reach and Longevity so think YouTube where you post a video today and
23:24
people will watch it for years to come and we also want to post content on LinkedIn because it works for months out
23:29
into the future and this is super important because I know a lot of us have full-time jobs and we really need
23:35
to crank on that leverage knob so that we can do work once and then the content will work for us as a digital asset and
23:42
we're not going to be posting on content on platforms like X because it's a constant Rat Race and you're running on a hamster wheel cuz every 24 hours the
23:49
clock starts over and we don't have time for that and next in every piece of content that we produce we're going to
23:54
give away everything we're not going to hold back anything and here's why people pay for two things they pay for
24:01
implementation and acceleration and that's what we're here for we're here to start a business we're not here just to
24:07
get popular we are starting a business so let me explain people pay for implementation and specifically taking a
24:13
step back when we create high value content that gives away all our secrets and shares everything people are going
24:19
to two types of people are going to pay for it one future employers and clients are going to pay for implementation
24:25
because they see that oh my gosh this guy can do exact what I want he's crushing it I need him to do that for me
24:31
so they're going to pay for implementation also there are beginner developers and creators that are a few steps behind you that want to accelerate
24:38
their journey to get where you're at so they're going to pay for coaching digital products and more opportunities to get where you're at so that's why
24:44
we're going to give it all away for free not hold anything back cuz knowledge is not the limiting factor it's it's
24:51
actually implementation is a limiting factor and direct coaching and helping people where they're at to get from
24:56
where they're at to where they're going so paying for acceleration so next what we want to do inside of our content
25:01
engine is we want to focus on building out an email list we are on rented land
25:07
when we're on YouTube and Linkedin and we want to bring them into our ecosystem and we're going to do that through irresistible lead magnets and the reason
25:14
why is not everyone's ready to hire or buy from you today but if they join your email list and you continually provide
25:20
value over time they might be at a later date and that way we can start to collaborate and provide value to one
25:25
another and the way we're going to do this is like I said do an irresistible lead magnet so think for example a free
25:31
source code a cheat sheet or a mini course all of these are great examples of lead magnets so for example in this
25:37
video I've talked about I've actually created a much deeper dive of the five pillars of creating an AI personal brand
25:43
I go way deeper than I can in this YouTube video and I definitely recommend you checking that down the description below see exactly what we're doing here
25:49
as well next what we're going to do is in the third step of our content engine is we are going to repurpose and
25:56
multiply your efforts so what I mean by that is every time you generate a lead magnet for your YouTube video we're
26:02
going to work to repurpose it to go over to LinkedIn why is because we as developers and creators have very
26:08
limited time so we need to structure our setup in a way to where we get to maximize all the juice and all the value
26:15
from everything that we do because we only have so many hours in the day and we want to post on these platforms that going to give us exponential results so
26:22
let me give you an example why we want to actually go ahead and put our lead magnet on multiple platforms is because the more people can see our name the
26:29
faster your Authority grows and the more opportunities are going to come your way and ultimately the more value that you put out into the world the more
26:35
opportunities are going to come your way so it's a win-win and that's why we're going to repurpose all lead magnets over
26:40
from YouTube to LinkedIn as well and let me just give you a quick a concrete example of this Alexandra one of the
26:46
students I've worked with she worked on creating an awesome video on mixtures of Agents created a great lead magnet of oh
26:52
by the way you can download this template and then repurposed it over to LinkedIn the same one like I said were
26:58
squeezing all the juice out of everything we create and this lead magnet exploded so as you can see on
27:03
YouTube it got 3,000 views great but she repurposed the same league magnet but just packaged it differently in a
27:09
LinkedIn post and it exploded this one post got over 100,000 Impressions over
27:14
on LinkedIn that's led to five paid opportunities and it's just exploded so hopefully the dots are connecting on
27:20
like oh wow the power of repurposing content in your content engine is insane so now we've kind of talked high level
27:26
what we need to be doing in our content let's actually dive into some more actionable steps on what you need to be
27:32
doing in creating you know proven content formats that you can copy and start creating videos on today so what
27:38
are we going to do first well the easiest way to create content for our Niche is to actually do a curated list
27:44
now this type of video format or LinkedIn post format is great for a few reasons you are going to say hey I've
27:51
done a lot of research and a lot of work and I put together the most high value actionable items that I think are going
27:57
to blow your mind and I'm just going to give it to you in a simple list people love list that's the other reason why
28:04
this format works so well is because it clearly explain to the viewer or the reader what they're going to get out of
28:09
this video and how you're going to take them from their current state which is interested to the final state which is like oh wow that was awesome you gave me
28:15
a ton of value and we're going to do that in a format of a list cuz the user will know and the viewer will know okay
28:21
he's going to show me three items so I can expect in the rest of this video or post to see three items that are going
28:26
to be awesome so that's why this really works so well and just to give you a concrete example of this we could do
28:32
some sort of video saying like hey here are three mind-blowing examples of open AI 03 Mini model that you should steal
28:39
so this is a really good example of like hey I've found all these things let's go ahead and let me show them to you so you
28:45
can see we're going to do you know item one example one example two example three and at the Final End we're going to say oh by the way I've made an
28:52
awesome lead magnet for you guys as well where I've actually went off and found an additional five examples that will
28:58
love click the link down description below and I'll shoot them over to you as well so it's always give value and then with our lead magnet we're going to give
29:04
even more value next another format that is proven that you guys should definitely copy and steal as you're
29:10
going off to create your first rounds of content is a simple how-to guide strictly a step-by-step guide so the
29:16
reason why this format works is because it provides immediate value to the reader or viewer and there's a clear
29:21
actionable outcome so by following this how-to guide by the end of it I know the goal is I should be able to do the thing
29:27
and and it really showcases how technical we are what we're able to do and our problem solving skills so once again we're building up our Authority at
29:34
the same time let me give you a concrete example of this and why it's such a good one so we could say hey uh in this video
29:39
I'm going to show you how to build an AI agent that scrapes competitor prices in five steps that is a very clear outcome
29:45
I instantly know what the entire video is about I know the entire format I know if I was to click on this video right
29:50
now that there would probably be some sort of intro and then there'd be step 1 2 3 4 5 and by the end of five I would
29:56
have a bot or agent that could go off and let me see all my competitor's prices very clear I know what I'm going
30:02
to get out of this video before even clicking on it and then the video format uh once again show the five steps and at
30:07
the end we'll say oh by the way here's the lead magnet here is all the code
30:12
that you saw inside the AI agent just go ahead and download it completely for free Link in the description below so hopefully you're starting to get the
30:18
format and feel for this and the the way we should go about creating content in our content engine and then finally the third format that you should steal is
30:25
the tip Insight list so with this one what we're doing is actually just aggregating a bunch of high impact
30:31
lessons to our audience because you know we as the expert have a ton of expertise
30:36
in a certain domain and we're just going to say hey I've spent hundreds of hours you know thousands of dollars working in
30:42
this field and here are a few tips and insights on how you should go about
30:47
doing X and the reason why this works so well once again it paints a clear Journey For What the viewer should do
30:52
like here's five tips on how to do X paints a clear Journey For What the user is going to experience as they're going
30:59
watching the video or reading the book and they're also going to you know once again you know have a clear
31:06
understanding of what they're going to get out of it so another example for this one would be hey in today's video I'm going to give you seven tips for AI
31:12
developers to use cursor like a pro so this video very clear outcome I I'm
31:18
curious in cursor and I do want to know how to actually use it better so I'm
31:23
actually going to go off and create a video on this exact subject later on because I think this is a between Claude and cursor there's a lot of interesting
31:29
things you can do in this field so same format I'm going to show seven tips and at the very end I'm going to say oh by the way if you would like to see even
31:36
more tips check the league magnet down below get it completely for free and you'll see another eight tips that I've added for you guys completely for free
31:42
so hopefully it's starting to all make sense of how it all connects together now we know what type of content we need
31:48
to be making where we need to post it we even know the format of what type of content to create but now we need to
31:53
focus on avoiding the most common mistakes IC beginners do as are going off and starting to crank up and build
32:00
their content engine so let's go ahead and dive in so the first thing is as beginners go off and start creating
32:06
YouTube videos and Linkedin post they don't hook the viewer and if you don't hook the viewer between your title
32:12
thumbnail and your intro basically the rest of the work is wasted because if someone doesn't click it doesn't matter
32:17
how awesome the video is on the inside if they don't click they don't watch and if they don't watch they don't get value which means you're not going to get
32:23
opportunities and leads so you have to hook the viewer you should spend the majority of your time in the beginning
32:29
thinking about clearly how to create a title and thumbnail that brings in people to clearly watch your video and
32:35
gets them excited to watch all right another major mistake that I've seen beginners make time and time again is they start filming without a clear three
32:42
line so they're going to go they get inspired by something they see and they just start recording and then they're kind of starting off talking about Ai
32:48
and then they hop over to oh I learned some lessons back from when I started my first job that you're going to find
32:54
helpful too cuz it's helped me and then oh yeah and then here by the way here's that quick how to guide on as we're you
32:59
know talking about this oh and here's a deep dive on this random subject and like they kind of hop around and what ends up happening is they get done with
33:05
the video and then they go shoot what should the title for this be and because they've scattered everything all over
33:10
the place the title will never match the viewers expectations of what they're going to watch each video should have a
33:17
clear single purpose and a clear single title that work together and just make it very easy for the viewer we want to
33:23
keep things clear because a confused viewer leaves so the actual tip out of this is focus on a clear title first
33:29
that you would want to click yourself and then focus on creating the video second then the third major mistake that
33:35
I see most developers make and sorry creators make on you know LinkedIn YouTube is they stop way too soon they
33:40
quit they make a few videos they don't get the millions of views that they expected they were going to get and they just give up and I know I've seen this
33:47
myself heck I did it myself the first time I created YouTube CU I just did not know what I was doing until I invested
33:53
in coaching courses and everything to figure out how the heck this game works and the biggest mistake that people do is the comparison game they see you know
34:00
the Mr Beast the huge YouTube channel that gets hundreds of thousands of views and they say dang my video only got like
34:05
500 views this is not what I thought it was going to be it's much harder I'm not getting job offers I'm going to give up
34:10
and the trick is do not play the comparison game to other people play the comparison game against your future self
34:16
so you know is your second video better than your first great just keep doing that and don't give up the only way you
34:22
lose this game is by not quitting or sorry the only way you lose this game is by quitting so if you don't quit you're eventually just ultimately going to win
34:28
so hopefully that makes sense as well now the solution to these major problems and the way I like to think about it to
34:34
like really help you know stay in it for the long game and this is an infinite game you can keep playing it forever is
34:40
to treat every piece of content that you create is an asset that's going to compound over time and work for you 24/7
34:46
around the clock so every time you make a video it's another shot at getting your Authority out there and to go off
34:52
and work as a digital asset 24/7 to bring in people into your sphere so that
34:58
you get more opportunities and just the rest it just works so don't give up and just think everything that you're doing
35:03
it's a little soldier fighting for you 24/7 around the clock and we just have to you know slowly build up our army all right so we've gone through everything
35:10
that you need to know about creating your content engine and I want to go ahead and give you immediate steps that you should take heck right now pause the
35:16
video and start working on these or immediately after watching this so here's what you need to do next when it comes to creating your first pieces of
35:21
content first pick a proven content format so like I said earlier let's get that curated list a how-to guide or a
35:27
simple list of insights next we're going to write a strong clickable title before
35:32
doing anything else so the best thing I like to do is think of what's a good video title that I would want to watch
35:38
myself so in my head I would love to watch a quick how-to guide or quick
35:43
seven tips on how to best use Claude 3.7 with cursor I would want to watch that
35:48
video right now so I'm going to go off research do all the finding around and experimenting and create that video cuz
35:54
I'm if I have that video that I want to watch I know there's probably thousands of other people that also want to watch the same thing and we want to be very
36:01
clear in the title seven tips for how to best use clawed with a cursor boom very
36:08
very simple next after we have clearly defined our title we want to work on making our engaging hook so the first 30
36:15
seconds are the most important of the whole YouTube video I have more information on this in the 5-day master
36:20
class in the email below but basically the first 30 seconds are the most important part of the whole video Once
36:26
someone clicks and if you confuse them they're going to just dip and your views won't explode on the video finally we
36:32
need to focus on making that irresistible lead magnet for your video that you pick so think cheat seets
36:37
source code resource guides or just more of what you did in the video that always works and our ultimate goal is to get
36:43
people off YouTube and Linkedin and in our email list so hopefully that all makes sense and now that you understand
36:49
like how to go off and create content that attracts attention it's not enough the next step is actually to start
36:54
turning that attention into real world opportunities and like I said content is not enough on its own and if you're not
37:01
actively connecting and engaging with people that message you on your videos and post you're just leaving an insane
37:07
amount of money on the table and that's what in pillar three it's all about it's all about transforming your audience
37:12
that's engaged into valuable relationships some collaborations and paid opportunities so that everybody can
37:17
win so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number three so you can see this all in action all right guys so welcome to pillar number three strategic
Pillar 3: Strategic Networking
37:23
networking where we're going to focus on turning in all those content that we're generating into actual conversations so
37:29
those conversations can turn into high paying opportunities so let's go ahead and dive in so one of the things that's
37:35
super important to note is posting content is just the start of building your AI personal brand because if you're
37:40
not actively engaging with the people that are commenting dimming or reaching out to you as you post content you're
37:46
leaving massive amount of opportunities on the table that could turn into really highp paying deals so here's the problem
37:52
content alone is not enough views and likes don't pay the bills but conversation with real people who have
37:58
problems that we can solve they do that is what pays the bills so if you're just posting and waiting for opportunities
38:04
coming to you you're missing the point here if someone watches your video they find it valuable and they drop a comment
38:09
like hey this is super helpful well if you don't go off and start a conversation with them how can they ever
38:14
hire you refer you or know you even offer help so that's exactly what we're focusing on in this strategic networking
38:19
pillar and this is where most creators fail they just don't fully complete the loop they get it started but they just don't go 100% so they create the content
38:26
that brings in the views which brings people directly to them but they never engage which never allows the cycle to
38:32
complete and get them paid so here's exactly how we're going to fix it with the Strategic networking so instead of
38:37
waiting for opportunities to start the conversations here's exactly what we're going to do first we're going to engage
38:43
so every time someone reaches out with a comment a DM or interacts with us in any way possible we're going to engage and
38:50
once we engage we're most our whole goal is to help we're try we're here to provide help and provide value to the
38:56
world to show showcase our expertise and that we're an authority in the space so if they mention that they're having a
39:02
problem we're going to offer free value that's all we're trying to do here free value because as long as we put enough
39:07
Goodwill into the Universe I promise you it's going to come back tenfold we'll talk more about that later on but if
39:12
someone does reach out with a prom we're going to say hey I actually helped a lot of developers in this space with that exact same issue can we hop on a quick
39:19
call for an hour 30 minutes so I can help you out and that opportunity and that conversation can lead to a real
39:25
opportunity for you we'll talk way more about how to monetize and pillar number four but for right now just know this
39:31
could be a really great opportunity for us and then finally what we're going to do after that quick conversation the
39:36
whole goal is to go hey I've had a great talk with you for the past 45 minutes I've given you everything that I know
39:41
about solving this problem and then we're going to go with the O by the way method where we're going to say oh by the way I've actually helped coach a lot
39:48
of developers who want to do exactly what you're trying to do in the past and I'd be happy to help then we can drop an
39:53
hourly rate we can drop a bundle of like hey I think it'll take four coaching calls to get you where you want to go is that something you'd be interested in
39:59
and the reason why this works so well is because over the past 45 minutes of the conversation we've just dropped
40:05
knowledge bomb knowledge bomb knowledge bomb so we've eliminated all friction because they see we clearly understand
40:11
the problem we've already told them how to do it like the how is not the magic sauce if you remember back from earlier
40:16
people pay for implementation and speed and we can offer help on either cuz we could build it if they want us to or we
40:21
could coach them along along the way so that's our whole goal value value value and at the end hey I can help help and
40:27
it's also important to mention if we can't help totally fine that happens all the time but what we're trying to do
40:32
here is basically play out the role of just provide massive value to everyone that interacts with us and put as much
40:38
Goodwill and Karma into the universe cuz like I said it will come back tfold and just to give you a quick caveat if you can't help totally fine because you
40:43
could always play matchmaker where you say hey I personally cannot help solve this issue I obviously told you
40:49
everything that I think you should be doing but I also know this guy who you would really like to connect with so you can always play matchmaker as well and
40:55
that's something else that I think you would find interesting it's crazy how many cool people you're going to meet as you go off and engage in this strategic
41:01
networking now let me explain why this matters first off it builds trust and people buy from people they trust and
41:08
that's clearly at the beginning of the whole call when we're doing a strategic call with someone we're just offering value and clearly establishing we know
41:15
what we're doing and building trust it also helps create opportunities so what I mean by that is even if the person we help doesn't need you know want more
41:21
help right now they might later and that's so important because we're just trying to we're playing the long game here and and we just know deals might
41:28
not always come in but we just want to know be known as the person who can solve problem so whenever someone does need help they reach out to us or they
41:35
tell their friend who's probably in the same space of like hey I know a guy that could help you with the exact problem
41:40
they're doing so we're just trying to create a network of people that know exactly what we do and how we can help
41:45
people so anytime on that person's radar an opportunity or issue comes up they're going to be directing them to us so this
41:51
is a really cool way of how we can exponentially grow our Network to just attract opportunities left it's wild h
41:57
how many things are going to come your way and then finally I do want to go ahead and say if you ignore this it's going to feel like YouTube and this
42:02
whole AI personal brand isn't working and the reason why is cuz you're going to start getting the views you're going to get the thousands of views maybe even
42:08
tens of thousands of views but then you're not going to get any results meaning you're not going to get any paid clients and it's because of that Gap
42:14
right in the middle where we're not having conversations so the second you start having conversations with real people the pipeline is complete and
42:21
you're going to start getting real opportunities just fall in your lap and if you don't do these conversations it's going to feel like you're just posting
42:27
in the void and you're getting views but nothing's happening so do not ignore this advice about doing strategic
42:32
networking so let me go ahead and share you some my personal stories that I had as I've gone off and started to actually
42:37
engage in this exact strategy that I've been sharing with you guys so I do just quick bit of background is when I
42:42
started I was so hesitant about you know going on these strategy calls helping people out what if I don't know what
42:48
they need help with what if what if what if they think I'm dumb you know I had so many like faulty beliefs of you know
42:55
instead of just going out providing value to the world I was just kind of like I'm just going to hold it all in because you know that's how people are
43:01
going to come and find me cuz I'm an expert I know what I'm talking about and it's just up to them to understand it
43:06
and that's not the case what you have to do is you have to provide all the value on the call because we are the expert
43:11
and we're confident in our abilities so what I did to start is cu I was unsure what to do is I started offering free
43:17
strategy calls on all of my YouTube videos hey you want help I have a account the link in the description below let's hop on a call I will help
43:23
you with whatever issue you're running into cuz I just want to start bringing people into my ecosystem so I can start
43:28
helping out and the part that is very interesting about doing it is everything started to change after I was doing this
43:34
strategic networking so let me show you the second I started opening up my doors for people to come in and start engaging with me my calendar instantly became
43:41
booked it was wild overnight I was like well I have no more free time at nights CU I'm just going to be on calls with
43:48
people left and right offering value and here's all the awesome things that came from it first off I would get on a call
43:53
with someone who was thinking about building some sort of AI tool course of an hour I would spend the majority of it
43:59
saying here's exactly how I would go about building and solving the problem that you're having and then at the end
44:04
of the call you know the guy would just look at me and go can I hire you like right now are you looking for a new job
44:10
so that just blew my mind of just like by helping someone out for 45 minutes an instant job offer would just fall on your lap also Consulting gigs will pop
44:16
up all the time of like hey we clearly see what you're doing you now understand where our problems are would you be
44:22
interested in like you know teaching our CEO or teaching our team about how to use AI for our speciic specific Niche so
44:28
those come into your lap as well and those pay very well and then finally you also get to meet a lot of awesome
44:34
developers who you know a few steps behind you but want to get where you're at so for example you might get a
44:39
developer to say like hey I watched your latest video it was awesome here's what I'm trying to build over the course of
44:44
the 4 five minutes we break down hey man here's the three steps you need to do to build the project if I was in your shoes
44:50
and at the very end of it you always get one of two options hey would you actually be interested in building this
44:55
for me I can pay you or or the developer would go oh I really want to understand how to do this myself do you offer
45:01
coaching so either way you can always help in any of these situations and it just completely blew my mind that I
45:07
would just you know I wasn't seeing results until I started doing this and the second I started doing this I was it's a game changer and I never want to
45:13
stop having conversations with real world people cuz it closed the loop and all the opportunities started to flood
45:18
in and then the best part about this is I had a lot of faulty beliefs of like man I have to have 30,000 50,000 100,000
45:25
subscribers for this to actually start working and that's not true I was probably in the low thousands of
45:31
subscribers when I started doing this and as I've worked with like Alexander Tim and others people are starting to get conversations like when they have
45:37
hundreds of subscribers it's wild and the reason why it worked is because we're planting our flag on a specific Niche and we are showing that we are the
45:43
best at what we do so you don't have to have thousand subscribers it works really well even at you know as you're
45:49
starting out and also just quick Pro tip on a side note when you're starting out with this strategy I know a lot of
45:55
developers and creators are going do have imposture syndrome of like what the heck do I charge like do I am I worth 25
46:01
an hour 100 an hour 500 an hour like no one knows how to charge so here is my step by-step strategy of how I would
46:08
figure out your hourly rate if you're starting out so to start go completely free just say hey I'm here to provide value your calendar is going to book up
46:15
like this and then what's going to happen next is you're going to go oh my gosh I have no more time in the day to do anything I have to bump my hourly
46:21
rate and we're applying friction so we're going to go free then we're going to book a calendar completely booked booked add friction 25 an hour 50 an
46:29
hour and then once again our calendar is going to get booked and then we're going to go up again 100 an hour and then our calendar will slowly start booking up
46:35
and then whenever your calendar levels at it whatever you're comfortable with maybe two three calls a week whatever works for you that's how you have
46:41
through the market figured out your hourly rate and it's just crazy as time goes on and more people know about you
46:47
your hourly rate is just going to keep climbing up and up and up to where you're charging hundreds of dollars and hour and this blew my mind when I
46:52
started to be like are you cool for a $200 $300 coaching call and people like yeah please let let's go so I just want you to know limiting beliefs and a lot
46:59
of impostor syndrome just know everyone has it and that's how I would my step-by-step strategy on figuring out your hourly rate so all right now back
47:06
to strategic networking and actually specifically what action items you need to be taking inside of pillar number
47:11
three so first off we need to make it insanely easy for people to reach out to so what I mean is you need to add a
47:18
clear call to action on all of your social media platforms LinkedIn YouTube everywhere else to say hey I offer help
47:24
if you want to talk to me at all click the link down description below so you can add in like a calendly link or you
47:29
can say hey here's my email shoot me anything I am so happy to help and the reason why is we just want to let people
47:35
know that we're available for help cuz if you know you don't tell people that they can't just assume that you're here
47:40
to help so we have to be very explicit and say I am here to help you next what we need to do is like we talked about
47:47
earlier we need to engage with everyone and the way I like to think about it is every time someone interacts with me
47:52
it's another potential opportunity to help but more importantly it's another chance for me to provide value to the
47:58
world because I know the more I put out there the more that the universe will give back so it is up to us to just give
48:03
give give give and until you know until we can't give anymore and just to be professional try and respond quickly and
48:10
really just to go ahead and start the conversation as fast as you can while they're interested while the lead is hot is kind of the way I like to think about
48:16
it and then most importantly I see a lot of developers get this wrong and AI creators get this wrong when they start
48:21
out whenever someone does engage they just respond with a oh cool thanks and that's not how we actually should be
48:28
engaging with people that we're trying to help we always want to keep things open-ended so you need to ask better questions so instead of just saying
48:34
thanks cool I appreciate you like the video no no no we're going to say hey just out of curiosity what are you working on glad you lik the video oh by
48:41
the way you know what's your biggest challenge with AI or just whatever you were talking about the video just provide a open-ended question back to
48:47
whoever's engaging with your content just so we can keep the ball rolling make a new friend help out new opportunity it's just we have to ask
48:54
better questions and then another thing I've kind of harped on this a lot but we want to deliver massive value on every
49:01
single call or really every single interaction we have with people the reason why is because the more insight
49:08
the more strategy and actionable advice you give the more you're going to be seen as an expert and then also it's
49:13
just going to make you easier to get hired and I used to have a lot of faulty beliefs of just like like I said earlier
49:18
I'm going to hold in all the good knowledge and like not share it and that's completely wrong give it all away
49:24
because we're not going to be a gatekeeper of knowledge our whole goal is to be an implementation expert or an
49:30
educator expert that's going to help people get to where we're at and then just final thing that I've kind of mentioned a few times now is after we do
49:36
one of these strategy calls or engagements we always want to say oh by the way I hope you understand everything that we've talked about today and I do
49:43
believe I could actually help you out with achieving your goal if you're interested here's how I can help and
49:49
this is where we kind of start to hop over to pillar number four which is starting to figure out how we actually turn all these conversations that we're
49:55
having at the very end how do we actually turn this into deals so we can start making money and
50:00
basically getting compensated for all the value we're putting out into the world so this is exactly what we're going to cover in pillar number four
50:06
we're going to break down how you turn the content the connections and all the conversations that you're about to have into high paying opportunities so the
50:12
money just starts flowing in and it feels so right so let's go ahead and hop over to pillar number four so we can start learning how to put some money in
50:19
your pockets all right guys welcome to pillar number four which is all about monetization and this is my favorite
Pillar 4: Monetization
50:24
pillar in the whole course just because this is where everything completely changes and inside of this pillar we're
50:30
going to be talking about how we're going to you know turn your AI personal brand into a money-making machine I'm
50:36
going to show you all the different ways you can make money all the different levels I like I said I'm so excited for you guys to see everything that's about
50:41
to come come this way all right so the most important thing to note is Everything Changes once the first dollar
50:47
Stars rolling in because you go from a hobby to a this is a business like it fully makes sense you see how you go end
50:53
to end of attracting eyeballs to actually making money and this is the section where it all happens and here's
50:59
the hard truth about it though if you don't have a clear monetization strategy you're just leaving a ton of money on
51:05
the table and you actually just might not make money if you don't understand what we're going to be talking about in this section so before diving into the
51:11
exact ways to make money I think it's important for us to take a step back and understand the three levels of
51:18
monetization with your AI personal brand and how we're going to start building in leverage to make more and more money as
51:25
we grow so let's go ahead and dive into to the first one so the first strategy and first level of monetization inside
51:30
an AI personal brand is oneon-one so this usually means coaching or freelancing you can do this right out
51:36
the gate and we'll talk about this much deeper in just a second but just know you can start doing this level level one
51:43
right out the gate as soon as you launch your AI personal brand next we're going to start going up the leverage chain and
51:48
we're going to start working on one to many so this is where you're not going to help an individual person you're
51:53
going to start working with groups of people and we're going to talk about why this is the next step in just a second
51:59
and then finally there's the Holy Grail which is the one to Infinity monetization level so this is level
52:05
three and this is basically where you're going to start creating digital products or SAS Services where every time someone
52:10
buys it from you there's no additional work so the important part though because we're going to dive deep into each one of these and talk about exactly
52:16
how you can make money with each one of these options is just to know these are levels because it takes time to get to
52:23
the infinite money level whereas the one-on-one coaching you can do immediately when you start your channel
52:28
so let's go ahead and dive in and actually make some concrete examples so let's start talking oneon-one monetization which is coaching and
52:34
freelancing so this is 99% most likely where your first dollar is going to come
52:39
from so this is you going off and coaching and helping other people who are a few step behind you or this is you
52:45
freelancing and solving problems for other businesses and this is exactly what I'm helping people do inside of the
52:51
AI Authority accelerator like I said 8we coaching program by the end of 8 weeks my goal and personal guarantee is you
52:59
will have one of these opportunities coming in so you're starting to make one of those monies or I'll keep working with you until you get one of these so
53:05
like I said so confident this is where your first dollars will come from I know I've harped on this a bunch inside of
53:11
this master class but it really comes down to understanding a core concept is that every time you are creating content
53:18
on the internet you're always attracting two audiences so one action gives two results at all times Learners who want
53:25
your coaching and buyers who want your implementation so this is why level one
53:30
is all about oneon-one help because this is exactly what our content is basically a lead magnet for it's bringing in these
53:37
types of people now here's how I recommend getting started with this one-on-one monetization level one so go
53:43
ahead pick an hourly rate so like I said I would start at $50 an hour minimum if you're new and then like we talked about
53:50
in the previous section with our strategic networking we're going to let friction be our guide on what we should
53:56
charge on an hourly rate so we'll start out $50 an hour and then our calendar will fill up with strategy calls and
54:02
freelancing opportunities where we're doing work and eventually we're going to say oh my gosh I have no more time hey
54:08
man I know we have been working at this rate but I have so much work to do and there's so many opportunities coming my
54:14
way I have to bump up to $100 an hour or $200 an hour whatever you know whatever
54:19
the market demands you're just going to keep bumping up your rates because this is I cannot express this enough we are
54:25
in the perfect opportunity for AI developers and creators the reason why is the demand is here every business
54:32
every every client every you know student they all want to learn how to use AI so the supply sorry the demand is
54:40
here and the supply AKA you as an AI Creator or developer you are in the
54:45
demand so the demand is small the supply is huge so people are just going to be throwing opportunities your way so you
54:51
will be amazed how quickly your hourly rate is just going to double and double and just keep going from there because
54:58
you're a wanted person and people really really need your help so so excited for you guys to actually see this in action
55:03
cuz it's unreal when you have to start telling people no and my rate doubled it's just the most mind-blowing thing that'll ever happen all right so now
55:10
going in the tradition of leveling up eventually what's going to happen is we're going to just run out of time
55:16
because we're basically going to start charging so much money per hour that no one can afford US totally fine that's
55:22
just how the market works you know $300 an hour a lot of people can't do that so and order for us to still provide value
55:27
to people we are going to have to move to the one to many monetization level
55:33
where we're going to share our time with multiple people so let me actually go ahead and dive into this so I can
55:39
explain and like I said this is strictly a forcing function of so many people wanting you you're going to have to
55:45
transition from a oneon-one to a one to many just where you're sharing your time and splitting it up so people are
55:50
splitting the cost for your time so it's affordable for them but you're still getting the the big dollars so let's go
55:55
ahead and dive into this so when you shift to a one to mini there's really two options so there's High ticket group
56:00
coaching so think a premium course anywhere from $2 to $10,000 this is where you know you're take you're
56:06
handholding a few select people on a desired Journey till they get a clear outcome that's option one option two is
56:13
a low ticket group subscription so think school this is the best way I like to think about it to where hey you know you
56:19
guys get to hop on premium calls get premium courses that I make just small ticket items and you're just constant
56:26
providing a value to a large group of people that are inside of your community so the reason why this is so important
56:33
is because we're starting to see how money works and how time works together in the one to many model you're trading
56:41
time you're trading the same amount of time but for a lot more money and you're scaling your impact so this is kind of
56:47
like the mental model of like oh this is actually how it really works and I want to go ahead and actually give you a few concrete examples of this monetization
56:54
strategy working so if you were to go off and create a school community that has 200 members where you're charging
57:00
$50 a month that is a $10,000 a month business and the part that's so wild is
57:06
these numbers are not crazy after a 6 months to a year on YouTube building
57:12
your AI personal brand there's no reason you shouldn't be hitting these numbers cuz basically the answer is are there
57:18
200 people on Earth who are interested in what we're doing and we can provide value to them on a month-to-month basis
57:23
the answer is yes it's just going to take work to get there and that means we can very easily with an AI personal
57:29
brand hit $10,000 a month we just can't quit that is the only thing we cannot do don't quit and you will hit this so it's
57:36
just a wild concept all right so now we're going to keep scaling up the leverage chain and this is where we
57:41
reach the one to Infinity monetization level where we're starting to sell digital products in SAS and I'm going to
57:46
explain why this is level three in just a second so once you reach level three things scale exponentially and here's
57:53
why instead of selling your time anymore you're going to be selling products that require zero additional effort on your
58:00
side to you know provide value so what I mean by that is like you're going to create a digital product that people can just buy Around the Clock you're not
58:06
having to hop on a call you're not having to use your time people are just going to buy it and this is where you're going to start making money while you
58:12
sleep you know I've built uh full stack AI marketing courses I've sold digital products in the past and there's I can
58:17
go aead and tell you there's no better feeling than waking up in the morning and just be like huh while I was sleeping last night I just made a grand
58:23
or you know hey I built a digital product 6 months ago and oh this weekend I made 500 bucks like there's there's no
58:29
better feeling than when you reach this level the kicker is it takes time to get here and let me actually go ahead and
58:35
hop over and show you why so it all comes down to one key fact Size Matters
58:41
the size of your audience determines when you can start to do level three of one to Infinity monetization so here's
58:47
why let's go ahead and look at a small example of a beginner Channel and let's say they have a 100 email subscribers
58:54
well if they're trying to sell a $200 course with a 1% conversion rate on that email list you have one customer and
59:00
that one customer is going to pay 200 bucks so you're going to go through the whole process of building out a course spend dozens of hours working on this
59:06
and then make 200 bucks not worth it this is strictly a scale problem now let's look at what happens if we sell
59:12
the same course but we've been in the game longer of building our AI personal brand and we reach 10,000 email
59:19
subscribers something that's totally doable in your first year of building an AI personal brand so let's look at these
59:24
numbers well with this the same conversion rate and the only thing that's changed is we've gone from 100 to
59:30
10,000 email subscribers we're now going to end up with a 100 people who can buy our course so the exact same course
59:36
providing the exact same value is now going to generate $20,000 for us when we do our course launch and what's Wild is
59:43
these numbers just scale so you keep chugging along building your AI personal
59:48
brand and now you hit 30,000 email subscribers 50,000 email subscribers well when you hit 50,000 email
59:54
subscribers in that same course you now just had a sixf fig course launch which is just like mindblowing that this even
1:00:00
exists but the key thing here is like we have to do a reality checked like beginners should not rush into digital
1:00:06
products because the math does not work so just keep it in your back pocket know that this is an insanely profitable way
1:00:13
to make money and it's just a little bit down the line but I still just want you guys to get excited to see what's possible as you go out and build your AI
1:00:19
personal brand now outside of those core monetization streams that I've showed you there's a bunch of other ways you
1:00:26
can make money building your AI personal brand so let's go ahead and dive into them so one and I think it's really
1:00:32
overlooked is just a high ping job offer inside the AI space right now if you're a developer it is not uncommon to get
1:00:39
paid you know $150,000 Plus in the salary plus you know a ton of money in
1:00:44
stocks so this right here if you just build an AI personal brand and you know a few months later it leads to a job
1:00:50
like that's a wild you just probably made so much money on your salary that this you know don't sleep on getting a
1:00:56
really high paying job next are sponsorships so this is where brands are going to reach out to you and say hey I
1:01:02
really like what you're doing it aligns with what we're trying to do how much does it cost to do a brand deal to where
1:01:07
you talk about us in one of your videos you will be amazed at how many companies are going to reach out and ask you to to
1:01:13
do this as time goes on you're going to get you know probably close to like 30 a week as your brand grows but you know
1:01:20
this is another way to make money outside of that there's YouTube ad Revenue so as you keep posting on
1:01:25
YouTube eventually you're going to hit the requirements to become monetized when this happens YouTube is literally
1:01:31
going to pay us to Market ourselves that's such a cheat code the fact that we're going to be proving and sorry
1:01:36
posting content that shows we're an expert at what we do people are going to watch it and YouTube's going to pay it for us there's no other platform where
1:01:43
you get paid to promote yourself so this one's a like I said complete cheat code and I you know it's awesome to make a
1:01:49
few thousand bucks every month posting content on YouTube and then finally as we' talked about earlier you can do
1:01:54
freelancing but eventually you're going to run out of time and what's going to happen is you could go down the agency or matchmaking route in this case in the
1:02:01
agency land you're going to keep getting deals thrown at you and you could either be the manager over a few other
1:02:06
developers to you know really crank out some awesome products and just make a lot of money between you know you charge
1:02:12
a $100 an hour to the client you Char you pay your developer 60 that 40 bucks in the middle is all yours and
1:02:18
completely you know you just make sure the progress goes smoothly for the project or you could play matchmaker
1:02:23
where you say hey a project comes in and you go hey I don't know I can't I don't
1:02:28
have time to do this however I know Bob Bob is the best builder when it comes to creating this type of stuff and I'd
1:02:35
happily refer them to you and you just take a 10 to 20% cut for being the Matchmaker in the middle and you do zero
1:02:40
work but still get paid which is just wild so as you can see there's so many ways to make money with an a personal
1:02:46
brand it just it doesn't seem fair it seems like you're cheating but that's just it's such an awesome opportunity
1:02:51
and that's why I've been doing this whole course and master class just cuz I want more of you guys to start doing this CU it's completely life-changing
1:02:58
now like I said there's unlimited opportunities as you go down this and I want to also talk about one of the
1:03:04
biggest benefits of building an AI personal brand when it comes to monetization and I don't think people
1:03:09
fully understand this so one of the best parts about building your personal brand is you're not locked into a single
1:03:16
business idea for example if you were to go off and build a SAS application
1:03:21
you're going to spend months creating it you're going to go pitch it to the world you know obviously you're going to try and be smart about it but it's going to
1:03:26
take time and you're going to pitch in this direction and then if it you know if it doesn't succeed and take off you
1:03:33
have to completely pivot tear all of that down and start over in a New Vertical there's no carrying over like
1:03:39
all your res results there's no leverage to add them to the next thing that you do you're always starting completely
1:03:45
from Ground Zero building up tearing down building up tearing down and there's no continuation from one project
1:03:50
to the next however with an AI personal brand every piece of content that you do
1:03:55
stacks on each other over and over and over again and brings you more leads then with inside your AI personal brand
1:04:03
you now have unlimited opportunities to try out all of these different monetization Vehicles so you're going to
1:04:08
start doing some coaching then you're going to say hey I've helped a bunch of people you know I've coached a ton of
1:04:14
people on this specific problem I'm going to launch a digital course you launch a digital course you help 200 people out you make a good chunk of
1:04:20
change and then you're just going to keep posting content bringing in more leads solve another problem another digital core course start building a SAS
1:04:27
app whatever you need to do you're just going to be able to keep stacking on you cuz you are the Cornerstone of the AI
1:04:33
personal brand and the business and as long as you keep providing getting new leads in you have unlimited shots on
1:04:38
goal of making money in new ways and this is like this right here I don't think enough people understand why
1:04:45
building an AI personal brand is the best business opportunity for AI developers in creators strictly for this
1:04:51
reason right here cuz the world's changing so fast and every other business punishes you in a fast changing
1:04:57
World cuz you're locked in in this one we're flexible we're agile and we're adapting to the market as things change
1:05:02
so this is why I love building an a personal brand so much and I hope you're seeing the power of it now we've gone over we've talked monetization strategy
1:05:08
but now we want to talk about scaling it so we so far have gone ahead we've picked your brand positioning we've
1:05:14
talked about content we've talked about networking and we've talked about making money but how do we connect all these systems together to grow exponentially
1:05:21
and that's what we're going to be talking about in pillar number five where we're going to start talking about the growth flywheel so you can see how
1:05:26
everything connects and honestly just explodes your success so I can't wait to go ahead and hop in and let's go ahead
1:05:32
and start talking about pillar number five all right guys welcome to the fifth and final pillar of growing your own AI
Pillar 5: Growth Flywheel
1:05:37
personal brand which is all about the growth flywheel and this is where we're going to turn all your systems into
1:05:43
exponential growth where we're going to start scaling your audience Authority and income so let's go ahead and dive in
1:05:48
to exactly what's happening inside of your growth fly well so at first when you're creating content and growing your
1:05:54
AI personal brand it can feel feel slow at start but once you begin to understand how all these different systems work together and compound
1:06:01
exponentially it's going to feel like momentum just doesn't stop once your flywheel starts growing so what's
1:06:06
actually happening under the hood inside of your AI personal brand is that you have a three part feedback loop so
1:06:13
what's going to happen is your content attention sorry your content engine is going to attract more attention which
1:06:19
then fuels networking then as your networking engine starts to grow you're going to build more relationships and
1:06:24
those relationships are going to turn into more monetization opportunities and then as you monetize those opportunities
1:06:30
you're going to be able to go off and create more content because you're going to be able to create more tips and tricks guides more how-to guides cuz
1:06:35
you've gone off and done real things in the real world and when you go off and create that new content you're going to say oh by the way I implemented this
1:06:42
exact solution for paying customers so we now have authority so then that next video hits harder so more subscribers
1:06:48
more networking more content and it just keeps going ever and ever and ever but this is how the flywheel works so it's a
1:06:53
three-part feedback loop where every system grows together and just shoots off like a rocket ship with exponential
1:06:58
growth so let me go ahead and just give you a more detailed example of the flywheel in action so you can see how
1:07:03
one video works to grow everything so here's what a single video can do for you inside of your AI personal brand so
1:07:09
you're going to go off and post a YouTube video that shows people how to build an AI tool then inside of that video once it goes live it's going to
1:07:15
attract new subscribers and it's going to spark some DMS with people who are interested doing the same thing that you were doing then you're going to go off
1:07:22
and have those strategy calls that we talked about in section number three which with strategic networking you're going to give away all the value that
1:07:27
you possibly can and if you potentially could help them even further you're going to say something like oh by the
1:07:32
way I actually help coach AI developers do the exact same thing that you're looking to do and you're going to go off
1:07:38
and offer a coaching package of like hey over four different calls strategic calls together I think I can help you
1:07:43
build the exact solution you're trying to do help get you there faster then you're going to go off and actually help
1:07:49
and do the coaching calls helping them achieve their goal along the way and then what it's going to happen is you're
1:07:54
going to see so many lessons learned that people had of with like they didn't know how to do something over here you
1:08:00
dropped a tip and trick over here that they found super helpful that they resonated with and then that is where we
1:08:05
start to complete the feedback loop where we're going to go oh okay I now know that you know people a few steps
1:08:12
behind me really struggled with this I need to go off and create a video on this and that's going to go off and make
1:08:17
new YouTube content it's really going to resonate because if one person had the issue there's probably chance that
1:08:23
thousands of people or tens of thousand people have issues with the same thing and we're just going to go ahead and create the feedback loop which has
1:08:29
making awesome content it's going to help with more networking and it's going to help with more monetization so they
1:08:34
all work together and just explode and really it comes back to a three-part feedback loop where it just goes content
1:08:40
networking monetization and then just repeat and every one of these engines as they grow your whole AI personal brand
1:08:45
as a whole grows as well it's just amazing how it all works together and what basically is going to happen is at
1:08:51
first when you're creating your a personal brand like I said it's going to feel slow you're going to be putting out content over and over and over again and
1:08:58
what's wild about these platforms like YouTube and Linkedin is they do have an exponential tendency meaning as you grow
1:09:05
you grow faster so your first video is going to get you know 100 views 200 views but your fifth video now that
1:09:11
YouTube's figured out who you are and you have an audience to already serve content to it's going to start getting thousands of views then when you have
1:09:16
thousands of subscribers and you make another video your new videos are going to get tens of thousands of views and it just literally shoots off like a rocket
1:09:22
ship but at first it can feel very slow so this is why I actually want to go ahead and talk about the next point is most creators never reach the point
1:09:29
where they feel that exponential growth and things take off and just completely change your life and the reason why is
1:09:34
they just quit before their fly will takes off which hurts me every time I see it happen because I know all the
1:09:40
rewards are saved to the people who don't give up so most people they'll post five videos get 10 views and quit
1:09:47
it's not their fault they just don't know how to properly create videos and it can be discouraging or they'll have three conversations with people as
1:09:54
they're creating their YouTube content and they'll hear I'm not interested and then also quit or they go off and offer
1:09:59
coaching once they get a no and quit and it's because it can be very discouraging if you don't see the bigger picture and
1:10:06
just know everything's going to scale and get easier as you grow your AI personal brand but if they had just kept
1:10:11
going what would have happened is their content would have started ranking and they would be known as the you know
1:10:16
Authority for their specific space their Network would have exploded to where now they're known as the go-to person for a
1:10:23
specific topic and opportunities are just just going to come out of the Woodworks left and right and they're going to have so many ways to make money
1:10:28
they can't even keep up with it and then also when it comes to it your you know opportunities just would have like I
1:10:34
said started flowing in so the main lesson here is consistency is the price of admission for your growth flywheel
1:10:40
you just have to stick to it and if you do the result on the other side like will be absolutely life-changing so I
1:10:46
want to go ahead and actually just cover a few things that have happened to me as I've built my own AI personal brand so you can see exactly what happened when
1:10:53
someone who started that had no idea they were doing bought courses along the way to try and figure out how to do it
1:10:58
and just promis themselves I'm going to provide as much value to the world as I can and I'm not going to give up those
1:11:04
were the only two requirements I had for myself when creating my own AI personal brand so as you can see this is the
1:11:10
epitome of building an exponential system like an AI personal brand or to start it's going to look completely flat
1:11:16
because YouTube's trying to figure out who you are we're trying to figure out how to make content that attracts views but eventually things are going to click
1:11:22
you're going to understand how to create content you're going to understand understand what your Niche is and then YouTube's going to then go okay here's
1:11:29
what this person's capable of doing and I now know who to serve their content to and it's just going to take off like a rocket ship from there so this is my
1:11:35
email list and as you can see I started to figure out what to do on January 2027
1:11:41
uh sorry January the beginning of January 2024 so that was a full year long of me not knowing what to do on
1:11:47
YouTube I was all over the place but I just told myself I can't quit and what the whole goal of this master class is
1:11:54
to do is that year of just giving up which I call beginner hell I want to shrink it to as to be as small as
1:12:00
possible so you start to see results as quick as possible so that's what this master class is for is to shrink it down
1:12:05
and then also the AI Authority accelerator it's to compress it to matter of weeks to compress beginner Health to a matter of weeks so you just
1:12:12
start to see everything take off like a rocket ship like Alexandra and Tim have seen like we talked about in the beginning of the video so but the cool
1:12:17
part is as you can see once things take off they just shoot like a rocket ship and I want this to happen for you guys as well and you can see over here on
1:12:24
YouTube as time goes on you know to start it's just a flatline and it's going to look very sad when you first
1:12:30
see it but just know as time goes on videos from last year are going to feed into your content system you know the
1:12:36
longer we stay in the game just everything takes off exponentially there's a reason Einstein said compounding is an eighth interest of the
1:12:42
world it's because as time goes on it's our friend and it just takes everything off like a rocket ship so let's actually
1:12:47
talk about some Real Results that have happened inside of my AI personal brand so the biggest one new jobs along the
1:12:53
way as um the second I started Crea my a personal brand and letting the world know that I'm a really good software
1:12:59
developer when it comes to building AI Solutions job opportunities started happening left and right so within a
1:13:04
matter of months I was able to you know go ahead and land a brand new job this completely BW my mind whenever I got to
1:13:10
hop on a call with the founder and he said oh my gosh you know we really didn't have like a formal interview cuz
1:13:15
he got to see what I was doing on my YouTube channel he's like oh yeah you look like you really know what you're doing this is awesome and you know it
1:13:21
just went from there led to new jobs and new jobs to where eventually right now I'm at CI an absolute dream job
1:13:26
literally could not be happier and I was able to only land this job because I've have been showing my capabilities inside
1:13:33
of my AI personal brand for the past year leading up to this point and each time along the way it's been more money
1:13:39
and more money and more fun honestly so I've just been very very fortunate and on all these companies were absolutely
1:13:44
awesome to work at outside of that there's been so many opportunities for coaching and freelancing so the first
1:13:49
year going into it I didn't really know what I was doing inside of YouTube and that's why I'm making this video to help
1:13:54
you guys you know save time and a headache there's a reason I have so many gray hairs and basically to you know
1:14:00
speedrun this so when it comes to making money so as you can see I actually started getting freelancing opportunities as soon as like 4 months
1:14:07
into creating my YouTube brand that was slight luck slight being in the right place at the right time but that's the
1:14:12
whole purpose of building an AI personal brand we it gives us opportunities that we would never realized without and then I started to figure out there's so many
1:14:19
people beating on my door for me to help them with their own content or with their own projects because they saw what
1:14:24
I was doing on YouTube so I finally was like hey these people want help let's actually start helping them so in the like June is time frame I started
1:14:30
actually coaching people as well which is one of the biggest things we talk about inside the monetization pillar and then over the course of the next 6
1:14:37
months I was just trying to provide and help as many people as I possibly could making money along the way so between
1:14:43
freelancing and coaching it was awesome at one point I actually figured out was like hey let's just start selling coaching and bundles like I've
1:14:49
recommended to you guys over the course of one weekend when I opened the doors it actually paid enough for my wife and I to go go to a nice trip to Mexico and
1:14:57
that's just like when my brain broke I'm just like oh my gosh there's so much money to be made inside of this so just
1:15:02
want you know like the the there is no ceiling to what's possible with building an AI personal brand then from there I
1:15:07
decided to go off whenever School launched I thought this was an amazing way to start connecting with a lot more of you guys so I went off and launched
1:15:14
my own community and since about you know maybe March is time frame 2024 I've
1:15:20
been able to grow a school Community to almost 6,000 members where I'm able to hop on weekly free coaching calls
1:15:25
provide a lot of value to everyone on the call and just you know kind of keep a pulse on what's going on in the world and just provide as much value as I can
1:15:31
cuz I'm a firm believer the more value you put out the more good things come to you too so as you can see that's another
1:15:37
opportunity that you can do as you go off and launch your AI personal brand and then I've also been able to create
1:15:42
and launch digital products like we talked about in the monetization pillar this has been one of the most fruitful
1:15:47
ways to go off and you know just bring in a lot of dollars really fast it blew my mind you know I've never had you know
1:15:54
a weekend to where you make like $20,000 plus it just absolutely blew my mind that that was possible and what's wild
1:16:00
about this is this was my first major digital product I've learned so many lessons I've learned so many ways how to
1:16:05
structure content how to pick a video topic I've learned so many lessons so I'm confident the next time I do a
1:16:11
digital course launch like this it will be twice that maybe three times that because I now better understand how to
1:16:17
do this and also going back to our growth flywheel you know as time goes on the audience grows so the same product
1:16:24
getting offered to to a bigger audience just means even more money so the kicker here is just don't give up but yeah so
1:16:29
inside the AI Authority accelerator this is one of the other things I do want to be talking with you guys about if you are interested in launching a digital
1:16:35
product how to actually go about doing it as well so the one thing I do just want to mention though is you just looked at a snapshot of me over the past
1:16:42
two years so none of this happens overnight but it can happen much faster for you guys than it did for me
1:16:48
especially if you follow everything that I talked about in today's video so the main thing is once the flywheel starts to spin as you saw earlier it just never
1:16:55
stops as long as you don't stop putting value into the world it never stops and you will grow exponentially and just
1:17:00
more opportunities more success comes your way now if you are interested in getting your flywheel to spin faster so
1:17:05
you don't have to go through that beginner hell like I said at the beginning of this video I am launching the AI Authority accelerator 8e program
1:17:11
that's focused on helping AI developers and creators just like you to build your personal brand and to land your first
1:17:16
paid client in just 8 weeks and I'll be helping you every step of the way we are trying to speedrun success inside the AI
1:17:22
Authority accelerator you can take everything that I told you in this video today and go off and absolutely crush it
1:17:28
but for those of you who are wanting to maximize and take as much advantage of you can of this AI you know explosive
1:17:35
wave that's happening right now in want to get to seeing results as quick as possible definitely recommend checking out the AI Authority accelerator there
1:17:41
are only 20 spots in the first cohort and like I said the initial cohort will be the cheapest cuz I'm offering a
1:17:47
Founder discount so if you are looking to start now is the time I'll actually send out you know the doors will open
1:17:53
for the program on March 10th and if you are interested in joining you'll be able to click the first link down the description below that'll put you on the
1:17:59
wait list and give you access to the 5-day master class on building an AI personal brand which goes even deeper
1:18:05
than what we've been able to to talk about in today's video and the program goes live on March 30th that's when the
1:18:10
first cohort gets kicked off and people's lives are going to get changed and I'm so excited for it so yeah but that's right for this video guys if you
1:18:16
have any questions about anything that I've said today two options either a drop a comment down below I will happily
1:18:22
help out and then also if you want to shoot me an email with any questions that you have feel free to over at Brandon Brandon han. I'll have a link to
1:18:29
it down in the description as well but yeah I cannot wait to see what you guys go off and do I cannot wait to see the amount of success that you guys have as
1:18:36
you go off and build your AI personal Brands I do ask that you please keep me posted cuz I love seeing you guys go off
1:18:41
and absolutely crush it so please keep me posted however you can but yeah you guys are awesome hope you have a great
1:18:46
day and I cannot wait to see you in the next video see you

## Video 2

Introduction to Prompt Engineering
0:00
here is 6 years of prompt Engineering in just 53 minutes I started working with AI back in 2019 using gpd2 and since
0:06
then I built a number of successful service and Consulting businesses the first that did 92,000 bucks a month the
0:11
second that did $72,000 a month and my current which just did $139,000 last month so I know how to build prompts for
Transitioning from Consumer to Playground Models
0:18
business purposes and the goal of this video is just to dump my brain and give it to you I want to give you everything that I know about prompt Engineering in
0:24
as quick and as compressed a format as possible if you don't know me my name is Nick and my whole thing is cut in the fluff so let's get into it so we're
0:30
going to be doing this whiteboard style I'm going to be covering both very deep foundational underpinnings of how llms
0:35
work and I'm also going to be covering some more tactical actionable advice for beginners and novices um so we're going
0:41
to have a good blend of both the very first thing that I want to cover right off the bat and this is this will immediately improve your ability to
0:47
prompt engineer is instead of using the consumer models use the playground or workbench versions of these
0:54
models so if you're unfamiliar to keep a to make a long story short this is Chachi BT this is
1:01
the consumer model this is what open aai the big artificial intelligence company is marketing to people and selling for a
1:07
monthly subscription because this is a consumer model they've made a bunch of decisions to try and optimize
1:13
performance for the widest number of people those decisions include they actually insert a bunch of stuff into
1:18
your prompt that you can't see and that you don't know about so if you really want to get good at prompt engineering you need to stop using the consumer
1:25
models okay stop using chat GPT stop using Claud and instead start using
1:30
their API playground or workbench models so this is chat GPT this is platform. open.com
1:39
playground chat and as we see here there's a lot more that we can manipulate on the right hand side we
1:45
have a variety of uh different tools we can select model types we can select
1:50
response formats we can add functions we can configure our models with Randomness
Optimizing Prompt Length for Better Performance
1:55
temperature max tokens stop sequences top P frequency penalty and presence penalties if you don't know what all
2:01
this stuff is don't worry too much about it right now in addition you also get to insert your own system message and then
2:07
you have the choice of being able to add user or assistant messages too so I guess the point I'm making to make a
2:13
long story short is this is really where you get into the engineering side of prompt engineering if all you're doing is communicating with the bass you know
2:19
Claude Haiku or Sonet um or the chat GPT model you're just leaving a lot on the table so right off the GetGo if you
2:25
could take one thing out of this video it's just move over to the API playground versions you're going to have a lot more juice that you could squeeze
2:30
the second thing I want to talk about is that model performance a lot of people don't fully understand this but model
2:36
performance decreases with prompt length so there's
2:42
actually a hack that you can do to immediately boost the quality of all of
2:47
your outputs and that's just make your prompt shorter this is a graph here that shows a variety of models and their
2:54
abilities to reason AKA do some task over the length of the input text input
3:00
text in this case is obviously just like your prompt okay so what are we seeing here just to break this down right most
3:07
people are probably more familiar with GPT for Gemini Pro than they are with mistol and stuff like that so maybe just focus on the green and then the purple
3:14
and I mean the Green's the highest performance maybe we'll just focus on that what we see happen basically is that when the input length is
3:21
250 accuracy is almost one one means you know it gets basically everything right so it's like 0 N9 or something okay and
3:28
then the second that we add more okay we see like basically neutral or maybe a slight elevation or something between
3:35
250 to 500 but basically everything after that we see a decrease and it just
3:40
continues decreasing the entire way through okay so in this case it's a mile decrease between 250 and 3,000 um right
3:48
I mean if I could quantify this probably be like 0.4 or something 0.04 sorry
3:53
which is probably like a 4% decrease on the Chain of Thought reasoning um but if we're using like the basic model gp4
3:59
this is the normal thing that you that you'll call Performance goes down almost 20% right which is pretty
4:05
crazy so what does this mean well a quick and easy hack that you can do to improve the quality of your outputs is
4:10
literally just make your prompts shorter now you need to also consider that um
4:16
you know the more examples you provide an a model the more context you provide an a model it also tends to perform better so what I'm what I'm not telling
4:22
you to do is to remove all of the rules and instructions that you're giving the model instead what I'm telling you to do
4:29
is take the same information and shrink it basically improve the information density of the instructions that you're
4:36
providing okay this concept in English is called
4:41
AO obfuscation espo elucidation and the reason why it's written like this is
4:47
It's supp supposed to be kind of a joke right this just means keep it simple stupid but the person that wrote it
4:52
decided to write it in an extraordinarily verbose way just to show you how silly it is to write in a way
4:58
that's more complicated than normal Al to make this actionable I'm actually going to run you guys through a real example where I pair down and break down
Simplifying Your Prompts
5:04
a very verbose prompt into basically something that says the same thing just in like a tenth of the words so I have
5:10
my playground open over here I've added a system message that says you're a helpful intelligent assistant this is just my goto and I have a very long and
5:18
annoying prompt over here all about content creation I'm going to run you through it but I'm going to do so using a tool called wordcounter.net I paste it
5:25
all in there and I'm also going to open up another wordcounter.net so that I can edit this in um a subsequent page you
5:31
guys could see the impact on the length so right now this prompt is 674 words
5:37
okay for informational purposes uh a word is about 1.3 tokens or so uh
5:43
meaning that uh a token is about7 words this is probably somewhere around 800 or so tokens okay if we go back to our
5:49
graph here you know 800 or so tokens is already a almost 5% reduction in
5:55
accuracy so if we can get this to around 250 tokens instead of 800 if we can cut this by a third realistically we're
6:01
gaining about 5% accuracy or quality right off the bat and that's going to be our goal all right so how would I
6:06
actually go about pairing this down well I'm going to save you guys the um bleeding eyes from reading this whole
6:13
thing essentially what I'm doing is I'm asking this thing to produce some content for me we're doing it in a very verbose way for instance it says prompt
6:19
for high quality engaging and insightful content creation we could remove that completely primary objective and overall
6:25
goal of this content request well really primary objective is a same I'm just going to say objective it delivers 99%
6:32
of the same meaning but we do it in tenth of the words and in fact we don't even need objective because we're about to tell the model what we want it to do
6:39
and it's sort of implicit in us talking to a model that obviously the objective is what I'm about to tell you okay the
6:44
overarching aim of this content generation request is to produce an exceptionally well structured highly informative deeply engaging and
6:50
action-oriented piece of content that lines perfectly with the expectations needs and desires of my specific target audience wow does that sound super deep
6:57
and well thought out well it's not good prompts don't look like this good prompts are much much simpler so remove
7:04
this all and say your task is to produce high quality content the final content
7:10
should not only provide value in the form of information but should also serve as Authority well research and compelling resource that the reader or
7:15
viewer of this video based can rely for accurate insightful and practical knowledge high
7:21
quality authoritative content the content must be structured
7:27
in a way that ensures optimal readability maximum clar in logical flow being an effortless for the audience to digest and implement the concepts being
7:33
discussed should also avoid this part's funny excessive fluff or unnecessary tangents that do not contribute to the reader's overall understanding of the
7:39
subject matter your task is to produce high quality authoritative content that is readable clear and
7:47
avoids excessive fluff awesome so we have delivered the exact same message
7:53
we've done so in about 200 or 300 fewer words okay audience understand the
8:00
people this content must resonate with let's get rid of that your
8:06
audience is entrepreneurs and business
8:13
owners it looks like individuals who active engage running businesses particularly those focus on automation so entrepreneurs and business owners who
8:20
care about automation scalability I don't know that seems kind of vague to me and operational efficiency I'll say
8:26
Automation and operations you're also writing for technical
8:32
professionals let's say Consultants because odds are they are probably technical professionals if they are
8:38
among the first group and then time conscious efficiency driven
8:44
individuals I don't really know exactly what that means but to me it sounds like fluff so I'm going to get rid of it given that the audience consists of
8:49
Highly capable intelligent professionals the tone style and depth as content must be appropriately aligned to match their expectations avoid condescending
8:55
simplifications but also ensure that even complex concepts are articulated in a way that remains accessible
9:01
so write access write in an accessible manner perfect okay
9:10
guidelines so we could actually get rid of this whole section to ensure the generated content achieves the highest possible standard of quality depth and
9:16
Clarity we just say guidelines okay use a
9:24
direct and Ampersand instead of A and D tone of voice
9:30
avoid excessive casualness well that's what direct and pragmatic means unnecessary humor well that's what direct and pragmatic means storytelling
9:37
well this actually seems kind of necessary or new so I'll say avoid storytelling unless a story serves to
9:44
reinforce a key Insight writing should be clear concise and free of unnecessary jargon well I
9:50
kind of already suggested that given my previous instruction so I can just get rid of this
9:58
completely okay the content should be defined divided into well-defined sections each marked by appropriate headings and
10:03
subheadings so use headings and subheadings that's
10:09
easy use headings subheadings and bullet points numbered lists and clear
10:17
formatting elements very cool Ur a logical progression from one section to the next well if it's high quality
10:22
authoritative content that's readable clear and avoids excessive fluff odds are we're already going to have that okay depth detail and level of technical
10:31
rigor the content must we could just get rid of that complete and just say go beyond surface level insights and generic
10:37
advice it should provide unique specific and highly actionable information that differentiates it from lower quality content available elsewhere we can just
10:44
get rid of that that is embedded this is also
10:50
embedded and this was already suggested over here so we just get rid of that
10:56
okay do you guys kind of see how this is working we've already cut this down to 250ish tokens from previously uh which
11:04
what I believe was like closer to 800 or something like that so just in me going through this prompt line by line and
11:11
removing the excessive verbosity it's called I've already improved the quality of its outputs by approximately 5%
11:17
obviously this depends on the specific model that you're using but this is one of the funnest games in prompt
11:22
engineering you're given a prompt that maybe a company has been using for their model and your whole job is just take
11:28
that thing make it 30% shorter and improve the quality of your outputs automatically by 5% so you can see you
Understanding Prompt Types
11:33
can get very far with just a few minutes the third tip I'm going to give you is
11:39
understand the different prompt types there are system user and assistant
11:44
prompts and these prompts are basically just the go-to for for all um large
11:51
language models at this point probably going to remain so for a while so if I go back to my chat GPT playground
11:56
example not that page this one over here and and actually if I just let's make this a little bit more Dynamic let's
12:03
grab my prompt that I've painstakingly edited over here let me just add this plus
12:10
button okay now what I'm doing is I'm embedding a system prompt which is at a
12:15
high level simply how the model identifies so this is who am I right
12:22
imagine you just turned on the IR robot
12:27
okay you just turned on this puppy and it's asking who am I all the
12:37
system prompt is is it's you answering that question oh you're a helpful intelligent assistant oh you're a an
12:43
email writing assistant oh you're a customer help desk assistant oh you are
12:49
a paperclip optimization maximizer who will certain and convert us all into aluminum right you are you are just
12:55
providing it simple straightforward instructions a very general one that you can use for most purposes you're a helpful gen uh helpful intelligence
13:01
assistant that works just fine we're saying that it's helpful because we want it to be helpful we're also saying it's intelligent because we obviously wanted
13:07
to like select an intelligent um you know an an intelligent example after that though what we have
13:14
is we have the user prompt so we always start with the system okay and I always recommend defining it
13:19
explicitly then the user prompt okay the user prompt is where you actually tell
13:24
the model what it is you want it to do and there's a specific structure within a user prompt that I will run you guys
13:29
through later but for now just know that this is where you provide the actual instruction to the model okay now the next sort of prompt is What's called the
13:36
assistant prompt if I were hypothetically just to press this button right now well it's not hypothetical because I just did it what's going to
13:42
happen is I just told the model to write me an article about birds and bees right I didn't say write it about birds and
13:48
bees you know I talked about doing it in the context of automation so let's see what it does birds and bees key insights
13:53
and analogies for business automation operations the birds and bees typically evokes blah blah blah blah okay great so
13:58
we're writing we're writing a bunch of stuff about birds and bees and how they can inform us as to how business Works what I have
14:05
now is we got the user prompt the system prompt up here the user prompt up here but now we've actually inserted an additional assistant prompt the output
14:12
of the model the thing that it just generated for us is now actually an additional part of our prompt called the
14:17
assistant and most people think well this is just the output of the model right I can't really do anything with this and here's where you're wrong well
14:23
what you can do is you can actually use this as an example to inform the model
14:28
whether or not what it just did is good and then use that as a template for future outputs okay what I mean is what
14:34
if hypothetically what if I said fantastic work now I want you to do the
14:40
same thing but do it for an article on stor delivery I don't know I'm just
14:45
making stuff up at this point what I'm doing now is I'm actually feeding in this prompt this prompt and this prompt
14:52
along with my n with my second user prompt and what I'm doing is I'm implicitly reinforcing that did a great
14:59
job on the last piece AK I wanted to do the same thing or I wanted to take a similar concept or similar approach uh
15:06
in order to do you know the next piece too and what we can see is you know we basically took the exact same structure
15:12
and format then we just copy and pasted it with this new uh you know with this new with this new idea the stor delivery
15:18
as opposed to birds and Beast now the reason why I bring this up is because this is at core at the core of all advanced prompting which I'm going to
15:25
get into now um but understanding how system user and assistant prompts work in concert and this this works across
15:30
all major large language models as the time of this video including Claude including you know uh deep seek and so
15:35
on and so forth understanding how that works under the hood is going to be critical in US developing higher level and more effective prompts the fourth
Utilizing One and Few Shot Prompting
15:41
tip I want to talk about is to use one or few shot
15:47
prompting now for those of you that don't know one few zero shot all these
15:54
terms that you may may not have heard these just refer to the number of examples in the prompt if if I run you
15:59
guys through another little piece of uh of Academia here this was a study that was done a while ago on the performance
16:05
of large language models across the number of examples they were given to fulfill a specific task and what I want
16:12
you guys to see here is that there are three categories there's few shot one
16:18
shot and then zero shot zero shot is blue and it always performs the worst F
16:23
shot is orange and it always performs the best and right now I just want you guys to take a look at just the distance
16:29
in accuracy scores between this few shot and one shot if we go all the way to
16:34
175b that's about the size of um some of the simpler GPT models you know gpt3 GPT
16:40
3.5 uh because the study was in a couple years ago and technology has improved drastically my inclination is you know
16:45
we're probably I don't know if it's like 400b now this trend is probably the same
16:50
although you know a lot of these models are now totally behind closed doors you can't really see so I think that this trend is even better than it is now but
16:57
but like let's just take a look at this if we just extrapolate backwards this is somewhere around 40% accuracy right this
17:04
is almost 60% accuracy meaning that there's an accuracy gap of 20% between zero shot and few shot okay but that's
17:11
not actually the important thing what I want you guys to actually look at is notice how the dis the difference in accuracy between zero shot and one shot
17:18
is greater than the distance in accuracy or the difference in accuracy between one shot and few shot this is like
17:25
10% this is like 7% this brings to a very important point
17:30
that very few people know about that's that if you insert just one example into
17:35
your prompt you will gain a massive disproportionate Improvement in accuracy
17:41
that out Shadows if you were to add let's say 30 to your prompt I think um this F shot specific study uh was
17:47
something like 20 and N is equal to 20 examples so the distance between zero and one was like a time and a half the
17:53
distance between 1 and 20 and if you think about it considering now that we know what we know about the length of an
17:59
input and then the um accuracy Improvement as a result of shorter and shorter inputs we can actually see a
18:06
trend here if we only insert one prompt or one example in our prompt the
18:12
accuracy will be as high as humanly possible because the prompt itself will be short and then we're also going to get a massive boost in accuracy because
18:19
of how we structured our examples here okay so this takes me to an important
18:25
point about user assistant prompts which I'll run you guys through in a moment but essentially I guess what I'm trying to say is this is The Sweet Spot this is
18:30
like the gravy this is where you want to uh sorry not here this is the gravy you can tell I had to re-record this video
18:35
twice now cuz been droning on for like two hours uh my OBS incense just broke unfortunately so I I finished it now I
18:42
got to come back and do it again but whatever maybe I'm just smoother now um so so this one shot uh plus you know
18:50
what we know about keeping prompt length as short assumingly possible this is really like the goldilock zone and this
18:55
is really where you want to be as often as possible so my recommend for anything Mission critical always use
19:01
at least one prompt where at least one example to coers the model into
19:07
providing you a more accurate result the fifth tip I want to provide is this notion of conversational
19:13
engines versus knowledge engine okay what do I mean by these two
Conversational Engines vs Knowledge Engines
19:21
terms well llms like Chachi BT and Claude
19:28
are almost like a human being that's read a quadrillion Books
19:34
Okay so if we got a book here this is my fantastic super detailed and amazing
19:39
drawing of a book so we could see here I'm quite the artist I'm like the Pao Picasso kind I think um not saying that
19:47
Pablo Picasso wasn't amazing he is for those the guys that know art don't scw me uh okay so an llm is just like a
19:54
person that's read like a million books and just like a person that's read a million books if you went up to that you're like hey tell me the boiling
20:01
point of X oxy pyc Benzene or something
20:07
that person may roughly know what the boiling point is of things that are in a similar class but they're not going to
20:14
know exactly what that is 99.9% of the time just like a human being llms often
20:21
know roughly approximately what a right answer is just because they've read so many books they've picked up so many
20:26
patterns between Concepts but they don't know exact facts so llms okay are not
20:33
knowledge engines what they are are conversational engines you don't use llms to extract
20:41
knowledge for the most part unless that knowledge is very old and very commonly
20:46
known instead what you do is use them to talk use them to have conversations use them to reason or something introductory
20:52
level reasoning still but still reasoning now contrast this with something like a database if you you
20:58
know I think most of us would probably use Google Sheets here right so you know in Google Sheets you
21:03
have some sort of column heading so XYZ a and then you have like the data for the headings so maybe X is like name or
21:09
something to make this a little clearer and then you know the value here is Nick um tables and and databases and
21:17
encyclopedias okay these are knowledge
21:22
engines they essentially know facts but you can't have conversations with them
21:28
right can't have a conversation with an encyclopedia the cool part about llms really is when you hook up an
21:35
llm to a knowledge engine and then you basically have
21:42
it query that knowledge engine for some facts or some information okay so llms
21:48
on their own like the GPT whatever series of models these are conversational engines they don't know
21:55
facts and you shouldn't really rely on them for facts they're going to be very comp ident because it's just like I don't know the some dude at the bar
22:01
that's like absolutely man I know all about medieval history from 1864 to 1899
22:07
right medieval history good God uh that's definitely not medieval history folks clearly I am a conversational
22:13
engine but they're not going to know the specific facts they're going to be very confident in explaining these things to
22:18
you but unless you actually hook them up to some sort of external knowledge base you use something like you know rag which stands for retrieval augmented
22:24
generation which is where you query some data set using an llm you you ask it to
22:29
find you some data return that data and then have the llm produce the response
22:35
okay um you're not actually going to get like any usable information for the most part and even if you do you know I I
22:41
wouldn't trust it maybe it's right like 70% of the time for most queries but that 30% um that means a lot in business
22:47
applications right you're never really going to get somebody to pay you a lot of money for some sort of business application if you're wrong 30% of the
The Importance of Unambiguous Language
22:53
time okay speaking of being wrong the sixth tip I want to give you is to use completely UNAM uous
23:00
language what do I mean by unambiguous language well unfortunately or
23:05
fortunately AI is extraordinarily creative okay because it's very creative that means that when you ask AI
23:12
something the first time it'll give you a different answer than if you ask it the second time and that'll be a
23:17
different answer than if you ask it the third time and a fourth time and a fifth time and a sixth time okay if I could
23:23
just give you guys a quick little example here if this was like um if you played one of those games where like I
23:28
don't know you have some Zone that you need to hit or something okay I don't know maybe you guys have play this at the arcade or whatever and and basically
23:34
there's this little cursor and it goes ding ding ding and you're supposed to just like stop it right when it's in the
23:40
middle of some little goldilock Zone well large language models are are very similar if we have like this little
23:46
goldilock Zone here I want you guys to hypothetically just think about this as this is the zone of responses that you
23:52
want okay this is you know the perfect output of your prompt it's the the best
23:57
ice breaker it's you know the the perfect report or or whatever basically the way that large language models work
24:03
are you know if you query it the first time maybe you get a response over here okay quer it the second time maybe you
24:09
get a response over here quer it a third time maybe you get a response over here maybe it's only when you query it like the fourth time that you actually get
24:15
the response that you want what you want to do is you want to you want to you want to minimize this as much as humanly possible okay you want to get all of
24:22
these as close to that little green zone as humanly possible and I'll show you a
24:27
practical way to do this in just a few tips um but essentially one of the simplest ways for you to do this is to
24:32
be extraordinarily unambiguous with what you want okay so to make this practical
24:37
um you know a big a big thing a lot of people will use AI for is it'll you know
24:43
you'll ask it to do something like produce me a report based on this
24:50
data this is what I would call a bad prompt okay do not do this instead
24:58
say list our five most popular
25:07
products and write me a one line or one paragraph let's say
25:15
description this is a better prompt and you get even better if you say here's an example of a
25:22
one paragraph description for another product okay so why is the first bad and
25:28
the second good well I guess it's good so let's do a check mark the first is bad because we're just saying producer
25:34
report produce is extraordinarily ambiguous a report is extraordinarily
25:40
ambiguous based on this data is also extraordinarily ambiguous okay ideally
25:46
you'd say here is the data you don't just like make your own inferences about what to use of this data why is this
25:52
good because it's specifically saying what we want we want you to list five most popular products like if you produce a report on some reports it'll
25:58
it'll do 10 products and other ones it'll do two okay it's just kind of up to like how the model is feeling at the time but if you hardcode it in and say
26:05
you're doing five products in addition you're writing me a one paragraph description of each and in addition here's an example of the formatting well
26:11
now what you've done is you've constrained all possible outputs so that even if they're not perfect okay what
26:19
they are is they're probably a lot closer to that goldilock zone of responses that you want instead of being
The Spartan Tone of Voice
26:25
super crazy spread out now they're at least like somewhere in the realm of what you constitute a good response
26:31
somewhere in the realm of what a business might want my seventh tip is a very quick and easy hack it's just use the term
26:37
Spartan in your tone of voice this is just one of those extraordinarily simple
26:42
things that you can just do in in every prompt um I just find the term Spartan is the perfect middle ground in terms of
26:49
like being direct and being pragmatic and then you know offering the model a little bit of flexibility so for
26:54
instance this guideline here I would I would write use a Spartan tone of voice I I think before I had um something different use a direct or or assertive
27:01
tone of voice just always say use a Spartan tone of voice your answers are just going to be way way better and way easier all right let's make this data
27:07
driven my eighth point is to iterate your prompts with
Iterating Prompts with Data
27:12
data now this is something of a more nuanced point but it's how you get the
27:17
highest quality prompts I see lots of people in my communities like maker school which is a day-by-day accountability program for people that
27:24
want to start an automation business it's something I've been running for uh quite a few months now a lot of people in maker School the way that they'll do
27:31
their prompt engineering is they'll spend all night coming up with some amazing prompt they think it's amazing anyway and then they'll run it once and
27:37
it'll deliver the most amazing output ever and they're like oh my God I finally figured it out I found the most amazing prompt I'm just going to use
27:42
this prompt for my business now okay the thing is do you remember earlier when I said that we have a range of possible
27:49
responses in the model sometimes it's going to respond over here other times it's going to respond over here other
27:54
times going to respond over here right odds are when you get a really good response in a model like 70% of the time
28:01
it's just because the model happened to produce something that was in line with your expectations but it wasn't
28:07
guaranteed to do so it just happened to do so so if you want to get prompts that
28:13
reliably and consistently produce outputs that are more in line with what you want what you have to do is you have to test them and then it's not enough
28:19
just to test them once you actually have to test them using what's called a Monte Carlo approach where you throw a bunch of stuff at the wall okay and then
28:26
progressively make changes to get it closer and closer and closer to where you want so I mean I don't if you guys
28:31
ever play darts okay but usually you have some like dart board and it looks like this and it's usually different colors and stuff and they're nice points
28:37
and you know like your your goal I think is you want to throw it like kind of over here all right so this is ideal
28:43
what usually happens is you know you're drunk as hell you start off playing darts you never played darts bar you throw one over here throw another one
28:48
over there throw another one over there throw one over there and you throw another one over there at the wall and hit the back of St you know Stacy's head
28:54
or something um every time that you iterate your prompt what you want to
29:00
happen is you just want the I guess total size of this to get smaller and more constrained so that's
29:06
that's route number two this is route number three and then ultimately what you want
29:13
is you want like a very accurate model that just consistently delivers you results in this perfect Zone how you
29:20
actually get there is you got to test and throw a bunch of stuff at the wall practically what this usually means is
29:26
you're going to do something like a Google sheet okay just like this you're going to have a prompt on the left hand
29:31
side you're going to have the output in the middle and then you're going to have another column that I just always call good
29:37
enough and then basically what you do is okay you grab your um chat gbt
29:43
playground in this case and then what you do is you generate 10 examples of what you want it
29:49
to do okay so for example this was one on birds and bees let me just delete
29:55
this other one so this is this is my my first article on birds andb so what I do is I actually paste it in here okay so I
30:01
pasted in the entire thing then I delete it all and then I do it again and usually
30:08
what I'll do is I'll use a no code model or no code tool something that just does things way faster um and then I'll just
30:13
like do it in the background but you know this is now like route number two so I'm going to wait for it to finish
30:18
its second output just for the purpose of this demonstration I won't do any more but basically after it's done with
30:23
number two I will copy all of this into another row okay uh that's not right
30:31
let's actually enter this and then what I'll do is I grab my prompt okay then I'll just stick
30:38
it on the left hand side on this prompt column and just because this isn't very viewable I'm just going to make this way
30:44
smaller so we could actually like see and maybe interpret this okay so I have two rows on my sheet
30:53
here right what I'll do after that is I'll do like I'll do another um I don't know I'll do like another 10 or
30:58
something like that uh and you know in my case I'm just going to do two but um in your case do
31:04
do 10 okay and what you do is you will read through every row and you'll say
31:11
hey is this good enough for my business is this good enough for the thing that I was hard to do this this good enough for the use case that I'm building my
31:17
automation for maybe this article is good enough maybe this one isn't okay so
31:23
we have one good enough out of two mathematically one out of two is equal to 50% %. realistically if I had like 20
31:30
of these or something like that you know what I would do is I would output 20 and then I'd go through and I'd read each of these and I'd ask myself hey this is
31:36
good enough and maybe 18 out of 20 are so if you know 18 out of 20 are then that's a total of 90% And then what I
31:44
would do is I would just test this against a different prompt so now instead of me just using my gut feeling
31:49
instead of me just having it generate one thing and me being okay with that one thing I have to do 20 and now I have
31:55
like statistics I basically have like some some science or some data behind my answer I'm like oh you know what that prompt actually beats the other prompt
32:01
19 times out of 20 that prompt actually beats the first prompt 13 times out of 20 that prompt actually beats the other
32:08
prompt 18 times out of 20 so what am I going to do I'm going to pick the one that's 19 times out of 20 and in this way you get more data driven and every
32:15
time you make a change and you run this test again you actually know hey I'm not just like throwing the most lucky bullseye on planet Earth okay I'm
32:23
actually statistically testing a big set of all of these outputs and then I'm finding which ones have higher accuracy
32:30
scores which ones are like more statistically correlated to the center of that Circle the ninth tip I want to
Defining Output Formats Clearly
32:36
give you guys is to define the output format explicitly okay what do I mean by
32:43
explicitly well I mean like there are a lot of use cases where you're going to want something like a bulleted list so actually like say output a bulleted list
32:52
that's pretty easy right but there's a lot more than you can do than that um you know in instead
32:58
what we see a lot of people do nowadays is we output code blocks so output Json if you don't know what Json is it's
33:03
basically like a um specific JavaScript
33:08
notation where you will generate some curly braces a quote inside of this uh
33:14
thing that's encapsulated by quotes you have the variable or key name then you have a colon then you have some quotes around a value then you have another
33:20
curly bracket this is a very specific format that now allows you to integrate your large language model with code
33:26
servers scripts that that sort of stuff um you know like csvs okay if you want a
33:34
a a Google sheet and you want the Google sheet to say something like uh I don't
33:39
know like month um
33:45
Revenue uh profit you can actually have ai generate this don't just ask remember how earlier
33:51
I I told you guys um that don't just tell it to produce a report so don't just say produce
33:58
a sheet about
34:05
financial data or something that is bad instead what you wanted to do is you
34:13
want to say generate a
34:18
CSV with month
34:24
revenue and profit headings based off of the below
34:30
data and now like when it gives you an output it's actually going to give you an output that you can just copy and paste directly into Google uh Google
34:37
Sheets or or Excel or something you know you're going to have data that looks like this month Revenue profit then
34:43
it'll say like I don't know January okay it'll say like 13,000 it'll say you know 3,000 it's not
34:51
going to have any commas cuz it's comma separated but I'll get into that later maybe February it'll say 14,500
34:58
then it'll pull from some spreadsheet and grab this much for you right like your data is going to be a lot structured so if you want data in a
35:03
format don't just have it generate a thing and then have you have to go copy and paste it into a spreadsheet or into
35:08
your app or into your program later like actually just ask it to do the exact thing that you want it to do right off the Geto I'll show you the exact
35:15
structure you need in order to get this to Output reliably in a moment the 10th tip is to remove conflicting
Avoiding Conflicting Instructions
35:21
instructions now this may sound pretty simple but it's a lot bigger of an
35:28
issue then I think a lot of people realize okay what do I mean by conflicting instructions well like a lot
35:34
of the words that we use we don't really think of but they have directly opposed
35:40
meanings I'll give you a quick example remember how earlier we went through and we made our whole thing really short our
35:47
whole prompt really short to take advantage of better accuracy well a word I always see and I've seen very often in
35:52
maker School my my 0 to1 community and then also make money with make.com which is a higher level Community um like a
35:57
lot of prompt engineering threads I see stuff like this detailed summary I want you to think about this logically like
36:03
if you produce a summary of something you are necessarily producing something that is simpler and smaller and and
36:10
lighter and and easier it's a it's a compressed form of you know the thing that you are doing you're basically
36:16
going you know from something like complex to simple right that's what a
36:24
summary is but if you ask for something detailed basically going from something simple to complex so then if you're
36:30
asking for a detailed summary what you're basically doing is you're it's like mathematically it's like it's like this equals zero okay it equals nothing
36:37
these two cancel each other out and what you end up doing is you just end up needlessly increasing token count for no reason so like when you say stuff like
Learning Data Formats: XML, JSON, CSV
36:44
produce an engaging article that is also very simple and straightforward or produce like a very comprehensive article that's still easy for newcomers
36:51
to understand right you're giving it conflicting instructions do you want it to produce something detailed or do you want it to produce something that's
36:56
that's not okay um just eliminate that it'll substantially reduce your token length and then it'll also allow you to
37:03
uh you know just get get a little bit better at defining things and and being simple and treating llms as I think that
37:08
you know they realistically should be treated which are tools that enable you to generate things not like at our
37:14
current level some super nuanced being that's able to like really fully understand the full gradient of the
37:19
decision that you've tasked it with the 11th tip I have for you is to learn JavaScript object notation XML then CSV
37:26
let's actually start with XML XML stands for
37:32
extensible markup language okay to make a long story
37:37
short all XML basically is it's just a way to structure data you remember how
37:43
like back in grade school um you know you would write a story and you write your name in the top left hand corner
37:49
you write the date over here you'd write the title over
37:55
here and then underneath here maybe you write the story right and then you hand
38:01
it in well all XML Json and csvr are just formats that allow you to embed
38:07
what all of these different things are in a simple and easy and standardized way um for computers to understand so
38:13
that you can do cool things with them like run you know cool programs and whatnot so you know if this is my big paper okay this is a big paper that I
38:20
wrote One me first place in school I got a $25 discard discard um a $25 gift card
38:29
to uh Denny's or something okay this is equivalent to this I have a little author
38:35
tag where it says Nick s then I have a closing author tag all
38:43
right this is now like universally understood that the author is Nick surve right maybe the date okay the date was
38:51
February the 19th and I close that tag off with date um title right well the title was
39:00
birds and bees right and I close out the title I could
39:07
go on and on but I think you guys understand this is a very particular formatting convention that allows you to
39:12
Define things okay if I go uh this one this one's pretty cool because I
39:17
actually used to um live and work in Sur so building ID Siri head office address
39:23
this is an address variable city city variable Province uh Province VAR country um country variable location
39:30
right you can embed data if I were to instead write a paper I'd say the sir
39:35
head office is located at 7445 132 Street which is in Siri BC
39:43
Canada I just want you guys to like see how much more every time I say Siri it
39:48
activates my Siri isn't that funny um I just want you guys to see how much more compressed this data is and how much
39:55
more immediately understandable this data is too so that's one reason why XML is awesome
40:01
um Json stands for JavaScript object notation it's very similar okay the only difference is instead of the tags the
40:08
less than and greater than symbols that we used along with some of those backs slashes um all this is is this is Curly
40:13
braces quotes characters um colons and then more curly
40:19
braces okay exact same thing right uh this would say
40:25
author and then this would say Nick sarf right exact same data if you could see
40:31
um Jason example you'll see data that looks just like this so instead of me saying hey
40:37
this guy's name is Richard he's a 33-year-old man who loves biking gaming squash and lives in Port space land he's
40:43
friends with Joe and Sarah and Michelle who are all you know 30ish somethings that live across the continent of the
40:49
United States like instead of me saying that I just create a little JavaScript object where the name variables equal to
40:55
Richard the age variables to 33 and so on and so forth and then CSV the reason
41:00
I bring this up is because this is a little bit more of a Nuance Point CSV is actually just the hyper compressed version of all of this where you don't
41:06
have to use these tag characters and you only have to mention the Thing Once okay so what I mean is okay remember this
41:12
author date and title a CSV file would actually just look like this author comma no space date comma no space
41:21
title and you'd have a little new line then here it would say Nick SV then it would say Feb 19 then it
41:29
would go birds and bees now this if you just like
41:35
count up the number of characters this is actually way less than all of this and the cool thing is when you do a new row you don't have to repeat the key
41:43
names what you can do is you can actually just you know um write the I don't know write everything in what's
41:50
called comma separated value format the comma here is the delimiter character the issue with using this in large
41:56
language models um is unfortunately large language models often lose their sense of place especially in longfall so
42:01
if you're producing a CSV that has I don't know like several hundred um inputs the large language model's
42:07
ability to like remember that the date column always comes second on I don't know like row number 1,00 and three or
42:15
something its ability to know that like date corresponds to Y it just tends to get muddled down which is why you typically only use csrees for for
42:21
smaller applications with large language models all right the 12th tip I want to give you guys is what I call my key
Key Prompt Structure for Success
42:28
prompt structure so I have developed probably over a thousand prompts now for
42:33
businesses my own businesses other businesses I work with people that I consult with and so on and so forth and
42:38
this is what I do um on basically all of them okay so feel free to copy this on your own um use this for all your own
42:44
promps I'm going to show you what this looks like first we start with context then I give it instructions okay after
42:51
that I give it my output format you guys just use this to scaffold your own
42:57
then I give it rules and then finally I wrap it up with an example so let me show you guys a quick
43:04
actual look at what a real prompt that has made me almost um $500,000 looks like I'm going to show you guys this in
43:10
a no code tool it's called make.com it's what I personally use and I teach a lot about it as well um it is for a specific
43:18
tool called upwork upwork is a tool uh upwork is a freelancing platform or basically you
43:24
can bid on jobs and stuff like that and this prompt was written to allow me to take as input an upwork job
43:30
description uh and then have ai automatically process it filter it tell me if it's relevant to me and then write
43:35
me a oneline Icebreaker that's customized to that job so how this actually looks I start off with a system
43:41
prompt that says you're an intelligent admin that filters jobs that's pretty simple right no real rocket science here
43:47
then I have my user prompt and the way that I want you guys to look at this is through that lens that I provided you earlier okay with context first then
43:54
instructions then output format then rules and then some examples so let me break this down for you this
43:59
up here this is all my context okay so what do I mean I say hey I'm an
44:05
automation engineer that builds Outreach systems CRM systems project management systems no code systems and Integrations
44:11
right I'm sure I could cut this down in hindsite now that I know a little bit more about prompt engineering I built this thing out um I believe over a year
44:18
ago now uh it was one of the videos that actually made me go viral on YouTube then I say below is a job description filter it for relevance true or false in
44:25
Json some of the platforms include use air table clickup chat TBT make Monday zap here LinkedIn Google Sheets if
44:30
relevant write a short introductory Icebreaker okay but I'm not actually done yet I then give it some example
44:36
client projects these are things that I've done and then I tell it my format okay so let's just be abundantly clear
44:43
here I provided a context over here then I gave it some instructions over here so
44:49
sorry I think I misspoke earlier this is my context this is my
44:58
instructions okay after my context and instructions what I do is I give it my output format which is right over
45:06
here and then at the end I also have some rules now in this case I wrote them as notes but these are essentially my
45:12
rules then finally I actually give it some examples and the way that you do this in make.com and any other no code
45:18
tool is you will have your user prompt up here with all of those four bits that I showed you a moment ago and then you
45:24
have another user prompt with your first example then another assistant prompt with your first result and in my case I
45:31
did I think three or four shots so then I have a user with an example this is an actual job description from upw workk
45:37
then I have an assistant response with a result then another user prompt assistant prompt another user prompt
45:43
assistant prompt another user prompt assistant prompt another user prompt assistant prompt I think in this case looks like I had like seven or six or
45:48
something like that uh in hindsight probably too much and I was probably forced to do this just because models were a little bit less intelligent when
45:54
I built this out nowadays I might do like two maybe okay I also also wanted to show like a wide range of possible jobs which um
46:01
obviously helped to perform and this is why I have almost $500,000 in posted earnings on my profile because I use
46:06
systems like this to be able to apply to large volumes of jobs I've also helped a lot of other people and build out processes that involve things like this
46:13
so um in a nutshell I almost always use this key prompt structure with some slight variations context is where you
46:19
tell it what you want like who you are and what you want instructions are where you outline specifically and say your
46:26
task is to do XY Z output format is where you say something like return your results in Json using this format rules
46:31
where you say hey here's a quick list I want you you know don't do this do this don't do this do this then examples
46:37
where you actually give it those user prompt or user assistant prompt pairs okay the next thing I want to talk
Generating Examples for AI
46:44
about tip number 13 is to use AI to generate
46:50
examples for AI okay what do I mean by that well if we
46:57
go back to that prompt that I showed you guys a moment ago right we have a lot of examples here what you can do instead of
47:04
you actually finding an examp examples you get you can actually like create one yourself right so I can actually go and
47:10
I can create one so what do I mean by this I could say um I'm actually going to go all the way down to the bottom and
47:17
I actually want to generate my own little assistant prompt right so maybe
47:22
what I'm going to do now is uh I don't know I'm just going to go into AI paste this
47:27
and say I'm using this for training write me a similar training example as
47:32
the above this is just using a simple hotkey um option space on Mac where I
47:39
can launch a chat GPT instance I should know that this is not the same as the um
47:44
API that I'm using right now but does a pretty good job right so now I have this and what am I going to do I'm just going
47:50
to right click run this module only and it's actually going to go through and generate me a result using AI right
47:57
pretty simple and easy now this was back in the day when you could not parse uh
48:02
the Json in the make Doom module anybody that is a little bit more experienced with make.com is probably looking at
48:08
this and being like hey why aren't you parsing this directly inside of the prompt that's just because the gbd 40613 model just didn't have access to do it
48:14
as you could see there's no there's no tool for me to do so but basically what we've done is we've outputed some Json JavaScript object notation which I can
48:21
then feed into this module here to parse automatically then produce me a variable that I can access that looks kind of
48:27
like this reason result Icebreaker the last tip I want to provide you guys is a pretty simple one but it's to use the
48:33
right model for the task okay I see a lot of people nowadays
Choosing the Right Model for the Task
48:40
using very simple models so here's how it basically Works
48:47
simple models are cheap complex models are more expensive so this is a
48:54
gradient between simple and cheap complex and expensive the unfortunate thing is like 99% of people that I see
49:01
in in maker School make money with make a comment on YouTube they're way too far on the simple and the cheap side of
49:07
things as of the time of this video there there a bunch of models available I don't really want to date this too much but you know a bunch of these are like mini models and so what a lot of
49:13
people will do is they'll just use the mini models because they think that it's saving them a lot of money well unless you're running something like that is
49:21
doing 5 million operations or executions a day like unless you're running some serious backend infra
49:27
token costs are so little that it doesn't actually make any sense not to just use like smart models
49:34
most of the time obviously there's some exceptions but let me just run you through what the gbt 40 family models
49:39
looks like okay this $250 cents per million tokens of input $10 per 1
49:45
million tokens of output if we just like average them and say I don't know for the purposes of this I'm just going to say it's five bucks per 1 million tokens
49:51
combined okay this upwork RSS feed thing that I just did if we look at the usage
49:56
okay combin it was 1,169 I would have to use one I would have to do this 1,000
50:02
times to use $5 that's crazy how many do I actually do a day like 15 okay if we
50:08
do the math on this $5 divided by 1,000 means that for every run I use
50:15
0.5 this is equivalent to uh
50:21
55.5 C so basically every two times I run this it's 1 cent it's it's a it's a
50:26
penny every four times I run this it's two every eight times I run this it's four
50:31
right it's such a marginal small amount of money that there's no reason and this is by the way this is using a GPT 40613
50:37
and this is also using like a very very under optimized Pro well maybe not very under optimized but pretty under optimized prompt with what I know now
50:44
the reality is you know like uh any case that you could use GPT 40 mini which you
50:50
know is understandably much cheaper but basically any use case you could use GPT 4 a mini for unless you're sending
50:56
Millions of tokens on a daily basis just use the smarter model the smarter model will eliminate like half of the problems
51:02
that you didn't even know you had and I recommend always just starting with a smarter model and then working your way down as opposed to starting with a
51:07
dumber model and then trying to work your way up just way easier to do that way so I mean you know 75 bucks per a
51:13
million tokens for 4.5 or 150 bucks for a million tokens like like yeah that's pretty expensive and I could see that
51:18
being a limiter but the vast majority of these o based multimodal models anyway
51:23
um as of the time of this recording are hyper cheap and usually recommend Just DE buying yourself debiasing yourself
51:29
and just trying to use the more expensive ones wherever possible because at the end of the day they're not really that expensive my company um which is
51:35
called one second copy we still use a lot of tokens on a daily basis I think we spent like I don't know five bucks
51:42
last month that's that's a company right makes several tens of thousands of
51:48
dollars still so if you think about like the the return on investment of these tokens it it's crazy so just make sure
51:53
you use the right model for the task most of the time that involves using a little bit smarter model all right
Conclusion and Call to Action
51:59
that's it for this video had a lot of fun recording it and re-recording it for all yall if you guys have any questions about this just drop them down below if
52:05
you guys want me to make videos on a specific topic then please I love getting ideas and I'm inspired for the
52:11
most part by people like you that actually take the time to leave comments down below saying Nick can you do a video x1z Nick can you do a master class
52:17
on prompt engineering so this video is because somebody earlier on in my comments a few weeks ago asked me to do this and I'm more than happy to do what
52:24
you what you want me to do as well otherwise if you guys do me a big solid anybody that's on the cusp of you know
52:29
starting an automation agency or getting up and running with their own business that hasn't had a lot of experience in
52:35
service companies or in any sort of automation scenario before I'd highly recommend that you check out maker
52:41
school it's my day-by-day accountability program and you can get the link just in the description I guide you through setting up essentially your own
52:47
automation outfit um from complete scratch and bootstrap in the hell out of it while you're at it and for anybody
52:52
that maybe knows a little bit more about business that already has an automation business for instance or somebody that runs uh a business in a very similar
52:59
