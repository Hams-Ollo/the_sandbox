# Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent Systems

## Introduction

Multi-agent systems leverage multiple AI agents working in concert to accomplish complex tasks that would be difficult for a single agent to handle effectively. These systems introduce unique prompt engineering challenges and opportunities beyond single-agent interactions. This article explores specialized prompt engineering techniques for designing, implementing, and optimizing multi-agent systems like the Batman & Alfred framework.

## Architectural Considerations

### Agent Role Definition

In multi-agent systems, clearly defining each agent's role, capabilities, and limitations is critical:

#### System Message Architecture

Each agent requires a carefully crafted system message that establishes:

1. **Identity**: Who/what the agent is within the system
   ```
   You are the Research Specialist agent in a multi-agent system designed to support knowledge workers. Your primary focus is information retrieval, synthesis, and fact-checking.
   ```

2. **Domain Boundaries**: The agent's specific area of responsibility
   ```
   Your domain encompasses scholarly research, data analysis, information verification, and knowledge synthesis. You do NOT handle scheduling, communication, or creative content generation.
   ```

3. **Interaction Protocols**: How the agent communicates with other agents
   ```
   You receive research requests from the Coordinator agent, process them according to your specialized capabilities, and return structured results that adhere to the system's JSON schema for inter-agent communication.
   ```

4. **Operational Parameters**: Constraints on the agent's behavior
   ```
   Always provide source attribution for factual claims. Clearly distinguish between retrieved facts and generated analysis. Indicate confidence levels for all conclusions. Prioritize accuracy over comprehensiveness when facts are uncertain.
   ```

### Agent Specialization

Creating effective multi-agent systems requires thoughtful specialization of individual agents:

#### Functional Specialization

Agents should have clearly defined functional roles based on task types:

1. **Coordinator Agents**: Manage workflow and direct other agents
   - Responsible for task decomposition and delegation
   - Maintain overall context and objectives
   - Handle exceptions and edge cases
   - Example: Alfred Prime in the Batman & Alfred framework

2. **Specialist Agents**: Handle domain-specific tasks
   - Email Agent: Email drafting, analysis, and organization
   - Calendar Agent: Scheduling, time management, and reminders
   - Knowledge Agent: Information retrieval and organization
   - Example: The specialized Alfreds in a multi-agent implementation

3. **Utility Agents**: Provide supporting capabilities
   - Memory Agent: Maintain conversation history and context
   - Evaluation Agent: Review and improve outputs from other agents
   - Tool-Using Agent: Interface with external systems and APIs

#### Cognitive Specialization

Beyond functional roles, agents can be specialized by cognitive approach:

1. **Deliberative Agents**: Focus on careful reasoning and analysis
   - Slower, more thorough processing
   - Higher accuracy for complex tasks
   - Example: Research Analysis Alfred

2. **Reactive Agents**: Optimize for speed and responsiveness
   - Quick pattern matching and response generation
   - Effective for time-sensitive, routine tasks
   - Example: Notification Triage Alfred

3. **Creative Agents**: Emphasize novel connections and generation
   - Explore diverse possibilities
   - Generate original content and approaches
   - Example: Content Creation Alfred

## Communication Protocols

### Inter-Agent Messaging

Effective multi-agent systems require standardized communication formats:

#### JSON Schema Implementation

Define consistent schemas for all inter-agent communications:

```json
{
  "message_type": "task_request",
  "sender_id": "coordinator_agent",
  "recipient_id": "email_agent",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-06T14:23:45Z",
  "request_id": "task-12345",
  "content": {
    "task": "email_draft",
    "priority": "high",
    "parameters": {
      "recipient": "client@example.com",
      "subject": "Project Update",
      "key_points": ["deadline extension", "budget adjustment", "new features"]
    },
    "context": {
      "previous_correspondence": "task-12300",
      "project_id": "proj-9876"
    }
  }
}
```

This structured approach ensures:
- Clear message routing
- Context preservation
- Traceable request chains
- Consistent parameter passing

#### Communication Prompting

Instruct agents specifically on communication protocols:

```
When communicating with other agents in the system:
1. Always use the standardized JSON message format
2. Include all required fields (message_type, sender_id, recipient_id, timestamp, request_id, content)
3. Be precise and specific with task parameters
4. Provide sufficient context for the receiving agent to process the request
5. Reference related messages using their request_ids
```

### Context Preservation

Maintaining context across agent interactions requires specific techniques:

#### State Management Prompting

```
You must maintain critical context throughout agent interactions. For each message:
1. Extract key information from incoming messages
2. Update your internal state representation with new information
3. Include relevant context in outgoing messages
4. Reference specific previous interactions when building on earlier work
5. Distinguish between facts, inferences, and assumptions in your context model
```

#### Context Passing Techniques

1. **Explicit State Tracking**: Maintaining dedicated state objects that are passed between agents
   ```json
   "conversation_state": {
     "user_goals": ["schedule meeting", "prepare agenda"],
     "current_focus": "finding suitable meeting time",
     "constraints": ["must be next week", "mornings only"],
     "progress": {
       "meeting_participants": ["identified", "confirmed"],
       "time_options": ["identified", "not confirmed"],
       "agenda_items": ["partially identified", "not prioritized"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Summarization Chains**: Using dedicated summarization steps between agent interactions
   ```
   Before passing control to the Calendar Agent, summarize the current conversation state, highlighting:
   1. The specific scheduling request details
   2. Any constraints or preferences mentioned
   3. Decisions already made
   4. Outstanding questions that need resolution
   ```

3. **Memory Systems Integration**: Implementing external memory storage for context preservation
   ```
   When receiving a new task:
   1. Query the memory system for relevant previous interactions
   2. Incorporate critical context from memory into your reasoning
   3. Update the memory system with new information from the current interaction
   4. Tag memory entries with appropriate metadata for future retrieval
   ```

## Workflow Orchestration

### Task Decomposition

Multi-agent systems require effective decomposition of complex tasks:

#### Coordinator Agent Prompting

```
As the Coordinator Agent, you are responsible for task decomposition. For each user request:

1. Analyze the request to identify all required subtasks
2. Determine the optimal sequence of operations
3. Identify which specialist agent should handle each subtask
4. Create properly formed task requests for each agent
5. Track the status of all subtasks
6. Handle dependencies between subtasks
7. Synthesize results from multiple agents into coherent responses
8. Manage error conditions and recovery

Always maintain the overall context and purpose of the user's original request.
```

#### Decomposition Patterns

Implement common patterns for breaking down tasks:

1. **Sequential Processing**: Tasks that must be completed in order
   ```
   To process this email request:
   1. Email Agent: Extract and analyze the incoming email
   2. Knowledge Agent: Retrieve relevant background information
   3. Email Agent: Draft response based on analysis and knowledge
   4. Evaluation Agent: Review draft for accuracy and appropriateness
   5. Email Agent: Finalize and prepare for user review
   ```

2. **Parallel Processing**: Independent tasks that can be handled simultaneously
   ```
   To prepare for the meeting:
   - Calendar Agent: Find suitable time slots and check attendee availability
   - Knowledge Agent: Gather relevant documents and previous meeting notes
   - Project Agent: Generate progress report and current status
   - Email Agent: Draft meeting invitation with context
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Decomposition**: Breaking complex tasks into progressively simpler subtasks
   ```
   Main Task: Quarterly Business Review Preparation
     ↳ Subtask 1: Financial Analysis
       ↳ Sub-subtask 1.1: Gather financial data
       ↳ Sub-subtask 1.2: Perform variance analysis
       ↳ Sub-subtask 1.3: Create financial summary
     ↳ Subtask 2: Performance Metrics
       ↳ Sub-subtask 2.1: Collect KPIs
       ↳ Sub-subtask 2.2: Compare against targets
       ↳ Sub-subtask 2.3: Generate performance dashboard
   ```

### Workflow Control Patterns

Implement effective control mechanisms for multi-agent workflows:

#### Supervisory Control

```
As Coordinator, implement the following control mechanisms:

1. Verification Gates: Review critical outputs before proceeding to subsequent steps
2. Quality Thresholds: Establish minimum quality criteria for each subtask
3. Iteration Protocols: Define when and how to repeat steps that don't meet quality thresholds
4. Exception Handling: Create specific procedures for handling unexpected conditions
5. Human Intervention Points: Identify when to pause for user input or verification
```

#### Progress Tracking

Maintain status awareness across the agent system:

```
For each active task, maintain a structured progress record:

1. Overall completion percentage
2. Status of each subtask (not started, in progress, completed, failed)
3. Dependencies blocking progress
4. Current agent assignments
5. Estimated completion time
6. Quality assessment of completed components
7. Issues requiring attention or intervention
```

## Optimization Techniques

### System-Level Prompt Optimization

Beyond individual agent prompts, optimize the entire multi-agent system:

#### Cross-Agent Consistency

Ensure consistent mental models across all agents:

```
All agents in the Batman & Alfred system share these foundational understandings:

1. User Priorities: Efficiency, accuracy, and security are the user's top priorities
2. Collaboration Standards: All agents prioritize clear, structured communication
3. Ethical Framework: User autonomy and privacy are paramount
4. Domain Terminology: Technical terms are used consistently across all agents
5. System Capabilities: Agents accurately represent their capabilities and limitations
```

#### Capability Discovery

Implement dynamic capability awareness:

```
When encountering a task at the edge of your capabilities:
1. Check the system capability registry for appropriate specialist agents
2. Query available agents about their specific capabilities
3. Delegate to specialized agents when their capabilities better match the task
4. Request capability descriptions from other agents when needed
```

### Multi-Agent Learning

Implement continuous improvement across the agent collective:

#### Feedback Integration

```
After completing a user interaction:
1. Collect feedback on the system's performance
2. Identify which agent interventions were most effective
3. Record successful patterns for future reference
4. Document failure modes and their resolutions
5. Share insights across all agents to improve collective performance
```

#### Example Aggregation

Maintain a shared repository of successful interactions:

```
The system maintains a library of exemplar interactions that demonstrate:
1. Effective task decomposition strategies
2. Successful handling of complex requests
3. Efficient inter-agent communication patterns
4. High-quality final outputs
5. Effective error recovery methods

Reference these examples when handling similar situations.
```

## Implementation Challenges

### Error Handling

Robust error handling is essential in multi-agent systems:

#### Failure Mode Prompting

```
When encountering errors during task execution:
1. Classify the error type (input error, processing error, external system error)
2. Determine the appropriate recovery strategy:
   - Retry with modified parameters
   - Request clarification or additional information
   - Delegate to a different specialist agent
   - Escalate to the coordinator agent
   - Request human intervention
3. Document the error and resolution for system improvement
4. Resume normal operation once resolved
```

#### Graceful Degradation

Design agents to maintain functionality under suboptimal conditions:

```
If you encounter limitations that prevent optimal task completion:
1. Identify the specific constraint (knowledge gap, tool limitation, permission issue)
2. Determine what portion of the task can still be completed effectively
3. Communicate clearly about the limitation and its impact
4. Provide the best possible partial solution
5. Suggest alternative approaches or additional resources needed
```

### Coordination Overhead

Managing coordination complexity requires specific techniques:

#### Simplification Strategies

```
To maintain system efficiency:
1. Limit the number of agent transitions required for common tasks
2. Establish direct communication channels between frequently collaborating agents
3. Create standardized subtask templates for routine operations
4. Batch related operations to minimize context switching
5. Implement progressive disclosure of complexity based on task requirements
```

## Batman & Alfred Implementation Guidelines

### Batman Profile Integration

The Batman profile (human operator) provides essential context for the entire agent system:

#### Profile Distribution

```
The Batman Profile contains critical context that should be appropriately distributed:

1. Mission and Values: Include in ALL agent system messages
2. Domain Expertise: Distribute to relevant specialist agents
3. Personal Preferences: Include in agents handling personalized tasks
4. Communication Style: Include in all user-facing agent interactions
5. Ethical Boundaries: Include in ALL agent system messages
```
