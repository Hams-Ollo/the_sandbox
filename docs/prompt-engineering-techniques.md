## PRIMARY DOMAINS (3)

### 1. PROMPT OPTIMIZATION FUNDAMENTALS

The foundation of effective prompt engineering revolves around understanding model behavior and optimizing communication efficiency:

- **Model Interface Selection**: Advanced prompt engineering begins with selecting the right interface for model interaction:
  - API playgrounds/workbenches provide greater control than consumer interfaces
  - Direct API access enables manipulation of parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)
  - System/user/assistant message types enable precise role definition and example demonstration
  - Consumer interfaces insert hidden instructions that limit engineering precision

- **Information Density Management**: Model performance correlates directly with prompt efficiency:
  - Performance decreases significantly as prompt length increases (up to 20% reduction)
  - Optimal prompt length typically falls between 250-500 tokens
  - Information should be compressed without removing critical instructions or context
  - Verbose language actively harms performance and should be eliminated

- **Example-Based Learning**: Models demonstrate significant performance improvements with minimal examples:
  - Zero-shot (no examples) performs worst (~40% accuracy in studies)
  - One-shot (single example) provides disproportionate improvement (+10% over zero-shot)
  - Few-shot (multiple examples) offers diminishing returns (+7% over one-shot)
  - The optimal balance typically involves one clear, representative example

### 2. STRUCTURED COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORKS

Effective prompt engineering requires consistent structural approaches to maximize reliability and performance:

- **Message Type Architecture**: System/user/assistant message structure creates the foundation for reliable interactions:
  - System messages define model identity and operational parameters
  - User messages provide specific instructions and input data
  - Assistant messages demonstrate desired output formats and quality
  - Sequential combinations create powerful one-shot learning opportunities

- **Key Prompt Structure**: Optimal prompts follow a consistent organization pattern:
  1. Context: Background information and situational awareness
  2. Instructions: Specific task definition and objectives
  3. Output Format: Explicit structure for response organization
  4. Rules: Constraints and guidelines for execution
  5. Examples: Demonstrations of desired outputs

- **Data Format Integration**: Structured data formats enhance integration capabilities:
  - JSON: Key-value pairs for integration with code and systems
  - XML: Tag-based structure for hierarchical data representation
  - CSV: Compact row-column format for tabular data (best for smaller datasets)
  - Format selection should align with downstream processing requirements

### 3. PROMPT ENGINEERING METHODOLOGY

Beyond structural considerations, successful prompt engineering requires systematic approaches to development and refinement:

- **Deterministic Output Control**: Techniques to constrain model creativity and increase output consistency:
  - Unambiguous language eliminates interpretation variance
  - Specific instructions reduce output variation across generations
  - Output format definition creates structural consistency
  - Example-based guiding narrows the possibility space

- **Data-Driven Refinement**: Iterative, statistical approaches to prompt optimization:
  - Monte Carlo testing evaluates prompt performance across multiple generations
  - Statistical analysis identifies reliability and consistency patterns
  - Systematic variation isolates effective prompt components
  - Progressive refinement narrows output variance over time

- **Model-Specific Optimization**: Different models require tailored engineering approaches:
  - Higher-capability models often justify increased costs through reliability
  - Simpler models require more extensive prompting and examples
  - Token costs should be evaluated against business impact and reliability needs
  - Engineering effort should focus on mission-critical applications
